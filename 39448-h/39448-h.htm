<p class="p6">[The following paper, by the author of "Tom Brown's
School Days at Rugby," appeared in "Fraser's Magazine:"&mdash;]</p>

<p>The heart of England has not, within the memory of living
men, been so deeply moved as by the Indian rebellion of 1857.
It was a time of real agony,&mdash;the waiting, week after week,
for those scanty despatches, which, when they came, and lay
before us in the morning papers, with huge capitals at the top
of the column, we scarcely dared take up, we could not read
without a strong effort of the will. What it must have been
to those of us whose sisters, brothers, sons, were then in the
Northwest Provinces, they alone can tell; but of the rest we
do believe there was scarce a man who did not every now
and then feel a cold sinking of heart, a sense of shame at his
inability to help, a longing to make some sacrifice of money,
ease, or what not, whereby to lift, if it might be, a portion of
the dead weight from off his own soul. By degrees came the
light. As the trial had been, so had been the strength. The
white squall was past; and though that great and terrible
deluge still heaved and tossed, we began to catch sight of
one and another brave ship riding it out. Our pulses beat
quick and our eyes dimmed as we heard and read how the
little band of our kindred had turned to bay, in tale after tale
of heroic daring and self-sacrificing and saintly endurance
and martyrdom. The traces here and there of weakness and
indecision only brought out more clearly the soundness and
strength of the race which was on its trial; and from amongst
the thousands who were nobly doing their duty, one man after
another stood out and drew to himself the praise, the gratitude,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
and the love of the whole nation. In all her long and
stern history, England can point to no nobler sons than these,
the heroes of India in 1857. Thank God, many of them are left
to us; but the contest was for the life itself, the full price had
to be paid, and one after another the heroes paid it. Some
fell, full of years and honors, whom the mutiny found with
names already famous; others in their glorious mid-day
strength; others fresh from England, in the first daring years
of early youth; of all ranks and professions,&mdash;generals, governors,
cadets, missionaries, civilians, private soldiers; but
each heard the call and obeyed it faithfully, loving not his own
life; and we believe that even in this hurrying, bewildering,
forgetful age, England and Englishmen will not let the name
of one of them die.</p>

<p>At any rate, there is little chance that the subject of this
paper will be forgotten by his countrymen, for not only has he
carved out with his sword a name for himself which knows
few equals even in Indian story, but he has left materials which
have enabled his brother to put together one of the best biographies
in our language.</p>

<p><i>Twelve Years of a Soldier's Life in India</i> is the history of
the career of Hodson of Hodson's Horse, the captor of the
King of Delhi, compiled from private letters written to different
members of his family.</p>

<p>To the book itself, as a literary work, high praise may be
awarded. There are four pages only which we could wish
omitted; we mean those (from p. <a href="#Page_432">432</a> to p. <a href="#Page_436">436</a>) which contain
the extracts from newspapers. Able leading article
writers and special correspondents, who as soon as the firing
is over, bustle up to battle-fields where their country's noblest
are dying, and sit down to catch the tale of every <i>claqueur</i>,
and spin the whole into thrilling periods, doubtless have their
use, and their productions are highly valued,&mdash;or, at any rate,
are highly paid for,&mdash;by the British public. The extracts in
question are favorable specimens, on the whole, of such commodities.
But Hodson has no need of them, and they jar on
one's soul at the end of such a book. With this exception,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
the book is a model of its kind. There is not a word too
much of the letters; in fact, we long for more of them, while
confessing that no additional number could bring the man or
his career more livingly before us; and the editor has, with
rare tact, given us just what was needed of supplementary
narrative, and no more, and has shown himself a high-minded
gentleman and Christian by his forbearance in suppressing the
names of the men who enviously and wickedly persecuted his
brother. In a charming little preface he compares that brother
to Fernando Perez, the hero of the later Spanish ballads, and
then seems to doubt whether affection may not have biassed
his judgment. We think we may reassure him on this point.
The career of the Indian Captain of Irregulars may fairly
challenge comparison with that of Fernando Perez or any
other hero of romance, and we may well apply to the Englishman,
lying in the death chamber at Lucknow, the poet's touching
farewell to the peerless knight Durandarte, stretched on
the bloody sward at Roncesvalles,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Kind in manners, fair in favor,</p>
<p class="i1">Mild in temper, fierce in fight;</p>
<p>Warrior nobler, gentler, braver,</p>
<p class="i1">Never shall behold the light."</p>
</div>

<p>But it is time for us to turn from the book to the man, and
we think our readers will thank us for giving them the best
picture which our space will allow of him and his work, as
nearly as may be in his own words; only begging them to
bear in mind that these letters were written in the strictest
confidence to his nearest relations, and that so far from wishing
to make his own deeds known during his life, he resolutely
refused to allow his letters to be made public.</p>

<p>William Stephen Raikes Hodson, third son of the Archdeacon
of Stafford, was born in March, 1821, and went, when
fourteen years old, to Rugby, where he stayed for more than
four years, two of which were spent in the sixth form under
Arnold. At school he was a bright, pleasant boy, fond of fun,
and with abilities decidedly above the average, but of no very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
marked distinction, except as a runner; in which exercise,
however, he was almost unequalled, and showed great powers
of endurance. None of his old schoolfellows have been surprised
to hear of his success as the head of the Intelligence
Department of an army, or of his marvellous marches and
appearances in impossible places as Captain of Irregular
Horse. Such performances only carry us back to first calling
over, when we used to see him come in splashed and hot, and
to hear his cheery "Old fellow! I've been to Brinklow since
dinner." But, as a boy, he was not remarkable for physical
strength or courage, and none of us would have foretold that
he would become one of the most daring and successful swordsmen
in the Indian army. We only mention the fact, because
it is of great importance that the truth in this matter, which
the lives of Hodson and others have established, should be as
widely acknowledged as possible. A man born without any
natural defect can, in this as in other respects, make his own
character; no man need be a coward who <i>will</i> not be one;
and a high purpose steadfastly kept in view will, in the end,
help a man to the doing of nobler deeds of daring than any
amount of natural combativeness.</p>

<p>From Rugby he went to Trinity, Cambridge, where he took
his degree in 1844; but, fortunately for his country, and (let
us own it, hard as it is as yet to do so) for himself also, a constitutional
tendency to headache led him to choose the army
rather than a learned profession. After a short service in the
Guernsey militia, which he entered to escape superannuation,
he got a cadetship, and embarked for India. Sir William
Napier, then Governor of Guernsey, gave him a letter to his
brother, Sir Charles, and himself wrote of him, "I think he
will be an acquisition to any service. His education, his ability,
his zeal to make himself acquainted with military matters,
gave me the greatest satisfaction during his service with the
militia." His brother's letter never was presented to Sir
Charles Napier, as we infer from the passage at p. 156, where
it is mentioned again, "I didn't show him his brother's letter,"
writes Hodson in 1850, "that he might judge for himself first,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
and know me 'per se,' or rather 'per me.' I will, however,
if ever I see him again." He never saw Sir Charles again;
but what a glimpse of the man's character we get from these
few lines.</p>

<p>On the 13th of September, 1845, Hodson landed in India,
and went up country at once to Agra. Here he found the
Hon. James Thomason, Lieutenant-Governor of the Northwest
Provinces, a family friend and connection, with whom he
stayed till November 2d, when he was appointed to do duty
with the 2d Grenadiers, and began his military career as
part of the escort of the Governor-General, who was on his
way to the Punjab. In that quarter a black cloud had gathered,
which it was high time should be looked after.</p>

<p>Hodson, however, marches on, all unconscious, and his first
letters give no hint of coming battle, but contain a charmingly
graphic description of the life of an Indian army on march.
Here, too, in the very outset, we find that rare virtue of making
the best of everything peeping out, which so strongly
characterized him.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"It is a sudden change of temperature, truly,&mdash;from near freezing
at starting, to 90&deg; or 100&deg; at arriving. It <i>sounds hot</i>, but a tent at 84&deg;
is tolerably endurable, especially if there is a breeze."</p>
</div>

<p>At Umbala, he attends a grand muster of troops, and sees
the Irregulars for the first time.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"The quiet-looking and English-dressed Hindoo troopers strangely
contrasted with the wild Irregulars in all the fanciful <i>un</i>uniformity of
their native costume: yet these last are the men <i>I</i> fancy for service."</p>
</div>

<p>This was on the 2d of December. On Christmas-day he
writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"I have been in four general engagements of the most formidable
kind ever known in India. On the 10th, on our usual quiet march we
were surprised by being joined by an additional regiment, and by an
order for all non-soldiers to return to Umbala."</p>
</div>

<p>Then comes the description of forced marches, and battles
which one feels were won,&mdash;and that was all. The same
story everywhere as to the Sepoys; at Moodkee,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Our Sepoys could not be got to face the tremendous fire of the
Sikh artillery, and as usual, the more they quailed the more the English
officers exposed themselves in vain efforts to bring them on....
At Ferozeshah on the evening of the 21st, as we rushed towards the
guns in the most dense dust and smoke, and under an unprecedented
fire of grape, our Sepoys again gave way and broke. It was a fearful
crisis, but the bravery of the English regiments saved us. A ball
struck my leg below the knee, but happily spared the bone. I was
also knocked down twice,&mdash;once by a shell bursting so close to me as
to kill the men behind me, and once by the explosion of a magazine.
The wound in my leg is nothing, as you may judge when I tell you
that I was on foot or horseback the whole of the two following days....
No efforts could bring the Sepoys forward, or half the loss might
have been spared, had they rushed on with the bayonet.... Just as
we were going into action, I stumbled on poor Carey, whom you may
remember to have heard of at Price's at Rugby. On going over the
field on the 30th, I found the body actually cut to pieces by the keen
swords of the Sikhs, and but for his clothes could not have recognized
him. I had him carried into camp for burial, poor fellow, extremely
shocked at the sudden termination of our renewed acquaintance.... I
enjoyed all, and entered into it with great zest, till we came to actual
blows, or rather, I am (<i>now</i>) half ashamed to say, till the blows were
over, and I saw the horrible scenes which ensue on war. I have had
quite enough of such sights now, and hope it may not be my lot to be
exposed to them again.... We are resting comfortably in our tents,
and had a turkey for our Christmas dinner." (pp. 66, 67, 68, 69.)</p>
</div>

<p>In the next letter the fight at Sobraon is described:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"On we went as usual in the teeth of a dreadful fire of guns and
musketry, and after a desperate struggle we got within their <i>triple</i>
and <i>quadruple</i> intrenchments; and then their day of reckoning came
indeed. Driven from trench to trench, and surrounded on all sides,
they retired, fighting most bravely, to the river, into which they were
driven pellmell, a tremendous fire of musketry pouring on them from
our bank, and the Horse Artillery finishing their destruction with
grape. I had the pleasure myself of spiking two guns which were
turned on us."</p>
</div>

<p>A rough baptism of war, this, for a young soldier! No
wonder that when the excitement is over, for the moment he
thinks he "has had enough of such sights." But the poetry
of battle has entered into him, witness this glorious sketch of
a deed done by the 80th Queen's (Staffordshire).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"I lay between them and my present regiment (1st E. B. Fusiliers)
on the night of the 21st of December, at Ferozeshah, when Lord
Hardinge called out '80th! that gun must be silenced.' They
jumped up, formed into line, and advanced through the black darkness
silently and firmly; gradually we lost the sound of their tread,
and anxiously listened for the slightest intimation of their progress;&mdash;all
was still for five minutes, while they gradually gained the front
of the battery whose fire had caused us so much loss. Suddenly
we heard a dropping fire,&mdash;a blaze of the Sikh cannon followed,
then a thrilling cheer from the 80th, accompanied by a rattling and
murderous volley as they sprang upon the battery and spiked the
monster gun. In a few more minutes they moved back quietly, and
lay down as before on the cold sand; but they had left forty-five of
their number and two captains to mark the scene of their exploit by
their graves."</p>
</div>

<p>And so in another month, when the war is over and the
army on its return, he "catches himself wishing and asking for
more."</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Is it not marvellous, as if one had not had a surfeit of killing?
But the truth is <i>that</i> is not the motive, but a sort of undefined ambition....
I remember bursting into tears in sheer rage in the midst of
the fight at Sobraon at seeing our soldiers lying killed and wounded."</p>
</div>

<p>His first campaign is over, and he goes into cantonments.
The chief impression left on his mind is extreme disappointment
with the state of the Sepoy regiments, which he expresses
to Mr. Thomason:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"In discipline and subordination they seem to be lamentably deficient,
especially towards the native commissioned and non-commissioned
officers. On the march, I have found these last give me more
trouble than the men even. My brother officers say that I see an
unfavorable specimen in the 2d, as regards discipline, owing to their
frequent service of late, and the number of recruits; but I fear the
evil is very wide-spread. It may no doubt be traced mainly to the
want of European officers. This, however, is an evil not likely to be
removed on any large scale. Meantime, unless some vigorous and
radical improvements take place, I think our position will be very
uncertain and even alarming in the event of extended hostilities.
You must really forgive my speaking so plainly, and writing my own
opinions so freely. You encouraged me to do so when I was at Agra,
if you remember, and I value the privilege too highly as connected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
with the greater one of receiving advice and counsel from you, not to
exercise it, even at the risk of your thinking me presumptuous and
hasty in my opinions."</p>
</div>

<p>Acting upon these impressions, he applies for and obtains
an exchange into the 1st Bengal Europeans, in which he is
eighth second-lieutenant at the age of twenty-five, the junior
in rank of boys of eighteen and nineteen. He feels that he
has difficult cards to play, but resolves to make the best of
everything, and regrets only "that the men who are to support
the name and power of England in Asia are sent out here at
an age when, neither by education nor reflection can they
have learnt all, or even a fraction of what those words mean.
It would be a happy thing for India and for themselves, if all
came out here at a more advanced age than now, but <i>one</i>
alone breaking through the custom in that respect made and
provided, must not expect to escape the usual fate, or at least
the usual annoyances, of innovators."</p>

<p>At this point an opening, of which he was just the man to
make the most, occurs. Mr. Thomason writes to Colonel,
afterwards Sir Henry, Lawrence, the new political agent at
Lahore, introducing Hodson; and at once a friendship,
founded on mutual appreciation, springs up between the two,
to end only with their lives. The agent manages to have the
young soldier constantly in his office, and to get all sorts of
work out of him. As a reward, he takes him on an expedition
into Cashmere, in the autumn of 1846, whither they
accompany the forces of Gholab Singh, to whom the country
had been ceded by treaty. The letters from Cashmere on
this occasion, and again in 1850, when he accompanied Sir
Henry on a second trip to Cashmere and Thibet, are like
nothing in the world but an Arabian Night which we feel to
be true. The chiefs, the priests, the monasteries, the troops,
the glorious country so misused by man, the wretched people,
an English lady, young and pretty, travelling all alone in the
wildest part on pony-back, all pass before us in a series of
living photographs. We have room, however, for one quotation
only:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"The women are atrociously ugly, and screech like the witches in
<i>Macbeth</i>,&mdash;so much so, that when the agent asked me to give them a
rupee or two, I felt it my duty to refuse, firmly but respectfully, on
the ground that it would be encouraging ugliness.</p>

<p>"I am the luckiest dog unhung (he concludes) to have got into Cashmere.
I fancy I am the first officer of our army who has been here
save the few who have come officially."</p>
</div>

<p>Colonel Lawrence was not the man to let his young friend's
powers of work rust, so on their return we find Hodson set to
build the famous Hill Asylum for white children at Subathoo.</p>

<p>We may as well notice at once, in this early stage of his
career, the man's honest training of himself in all ways, great
and small, to take his place, and do his work in his world-battle;
how he faces all tasks, however unwonted, ill-paid, or
humble, which seem to be helpful; how he casts off all habits,
however pleasant or harmless, which may prove hindrances.
And this he does with no parade or fine sentiment, but simply,
almost unconsciously, often with a sort of apology which is
humorously pathetic. For example, when set to work on the
Asylum, he writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Colonel Lawrence seems determined I shall have nothing to stop
me, for his invariable reply to every question is, 'Act on your own
judgment,' 'Do what you think right,' 'I give you <i>carte blanche</i> to
act in my name, and draw on my funds,' and so forth."</p>
</div>

<p>Which confidence is worthily bestowed. Hodson sets to
work, forgetting all professional etiquette, and giving up society
for the time.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Cutting trees down, getting lime burnt, bricks made, planks sawn
up, the ground got ready, and then watching the work foot by foot;
showing this "nigger" how to lay his bricks, another the proper proportions
of a beam, another the construction of a door, and to the
several artisans the mysteries of a screw, a nail, a hinge. You cannot
say to a man, 'Make me a wall or a door,' but you must, with
your own hands, measure out his work, teach him to saw away here,
to plane there, or drive such a nail, or insinuate such a suspicion of
glue. And when it comes to be considered that this is altogether new
work to me, and has to be excuded by cogitation on the spot, so as to
give an answer to every inquirer, you may understand the amount of
personal exertion and attention required for the work."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span></p>
</div>

<p>Again, a few months later, November, 1847,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"I am in a high queer-looking native house among the ruins of this
old stronghold of the Pathans, with orders 'to make a good road from
Lahore to the Sutlej, distance forty miles,' in as brief a space as possible.
On the willing-to-be-generally-useful principle, this is all very
well, and one gets used to turning one's hand to everything, but certainly
(but for circumstances over which I had no control) I always
labored under the impression that I knew nothing at all about the
matter. However, Colonel Lawrence walked into my room promiscuously
one morning, and said, 'Oh, Hodson, we have agreed that
you must take in hand the road to Ferozepore. You can start in a
day or two;' and <i>here I am</i>."</p>
</div>

<p>Again, in January, 1848, he has been sent out surveying.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"My present <i>r&ocirc;le</i> is to survey a part of the country lying along the
left bank of the Ravee and below the hills, and I am daily and all
day at work with compasses and chain, pen and pencil, following
streams, diving into valleys, burrowing into hills, to complete my work.
I need hardly remark, that, having never attempted anything of the
kind hitherto, it is bothering at first."</p>
</div>

<p>Again, in April, 1848, he has been set to hear all manner
of cases, civil, criminal, and revenue, in the Lahore Court.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"The duty is of vast importance, and I sometimes feel a half sensation
of modesty at being set down to administer justice in such matters
so early, and without previous training. A little practice, patience,
and reflection, settle most cases to one's satisfaction however;
and one must be content with substantial justice as distinguished
from technical law."</p>
</div>

<p>Again, in a letter to his brother,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Did I tell you, by-the-bye, that I abjured tobacco when I left England,
and that I have never been tempted by even a night's <i>al fresco</i>
to resume the delusive habit? Nor have I told you (because I despaired
of your believing it) that I have declined from the paths of
virtue in respect of beer also, these two years past, seldom or never
tasting that once idolized stimulant!"</p>
</div>

<p>We have no space to comment; and can only hope that any
gallant young oarsman or cricketer bound for India who may
read this, will have the courage to follow Hodson's example,
if he finds himself the better for abstinence, notwithstanding
the fascination of the drink itself, and the cherished associations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
which twine round the pewter. My dear boys, remember,
as Hodson did, that if you are to get on well in India it
will be owing, physically speaking, to your digestions.</p>

<p>These glimpses will enable the reader to picture to himself
how Hodson, now Assistant to the Resident at Lahore, as well
as second in command of the Guides, was spending his time
between the first and the final Sikh war. Let him throw in
this description of the duties of "The Guides":&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"The grand object of the corps is to train a body of men in peace to
be efficient in war; to be not only acquainted with localities, roads,
rivers, hills, ferries, and passes, but have a good idea of the produce
and supplies available in any part of the country; to give <i>accurate</i>
information, not running open-mouthed to say that 10,000 horsemen
and a thousand guns are coming, (in true native style,) but to stop to
see whether it may not really be only a common cart and a few wild
horsemen who are kicking up all the dust; to call twenty-five by its
right name, and not say <i>fifty</i> for short, as most natives do. This of
course wants a great deal of careful instruction and attention. Beyond
this, the officers should give a tolerably correct sketch and report
of any country through which they may pass, be <i>au fait</i> at
routes and means of feeding troops, and above all (and here you come
close upon political duties) keep an eye on the doings of the neighbors,
and the state of the country, so as to be able to give such information
as may lead to any outbreak being nipped in the bud."</p>
</div>

<p>The reader will probably now be of opinion that the young
lieutenant, willing to make himself generally useful, and given
to locomotion, will be not unlikely to turn out a very tough
nut for the Sikhs to crack when they have quite made up their
minds to risk another fight; and that time is rapidly drawing
near. All through the spring and early summer months there
are tumults and risings, which tell of a wide conspiracy.
Hodson, after a narrow escape of accompanying Agnew to
Mooltan, is scouring the country backwards and forwards,
catching rebels and picking up news. In September, the
Sikhs openly join the rebel Moolraj. General Whish is
obliged to raise the siege of Mooltan; the grand struggle between
the cow-killers and cow-worshippers on the banks of
the Chenab has begun.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span></p>

<p>We wish we had space to follow Hodson and his Guides
through the series of daring exploits by which the Doab was
cleared, and which so enraged the Sikhs that "party after
party were sent to polish me off, and at one time I couldn't
stir about the country without having bullets sent at my head
from every bush and wall." He was attached to Wheeler's
brigade during the greater part of the struggle, but joined the
army of the Punjaub in time for the battle of Gujerat, which
finished the war, and at which he and Lumsden his commander,
and Lake of the Engineers, are mentioned in Lord
Gough's despatch as most active in conveying orders throughout
the action. We cannot however resist one story. The
old Brigadier, making all haste to join the grand army, where
he expects to get a division, leaves two forts at Kulallwala and
4000 unbeaten rebels in his rear. He is ordered back to account
for them, whereupon Brigadier turns sulky. Hodson
urges him to move on like lightning and crush them, but "he
would not, and began to make short marches, so I was compelled
to outman&oelig;uvre him by a bold stroke." Accordingly
he starts with 100 of his Guides, when twenty-five miles from
Kulallwala, and fairly frightens a doubtful sirdar, "preparing
munitions of war, mounting guns, and looking saucy," out of
his fort. Whereupon the Sikhs abandon a neighboring fort,
and the road to Kulallwala is open without a shot fired.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"In the morning I marched with my little party towards the enemy,
sending back a messenger to the Brigadier to say that I was close to
the place, and that if he did not come on sharp they would run away
or overwhelm me. He was dreadfully angry, but came on like a good
boy! When within a mile or so of the fort, I halted my party to
allow his column to get up nearer, and as soon as I could see it, moved
on quietly. The <i>ruse</i> told to perfection: thinking they had only 100
men and myself to deal with, the Sikhs advanced in strength, thirty
to one, to meet me, with colors flying and drums beating. Just then
a breeze sprung up, the dust blew aside, and the long line of horsemen
coming on rapidly behind my party burst upon their senses. They
turned instantly, and made for the fort; so, leaving my men to advance
quietly after them, I galloped up to the Brigadier, pointed out the
flying Sikhs, explained their position, and begged him to charge
them. He melted from his wrath, and told two regiments of Irregulars
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
to follow my guidance. On we went at the gallop, cut in
amongst the fugitives, and punished them fearfully."</p>
</div>

<p>"The Brigadier has grown quite active, and <i>very fond of
me</i> since that day at Kulallwala, though he had the wit to
see how brown I had done him by making him march two
marches in one." It is certainly to the Brigadier's credit that
he does seem to have appreciated his provoking "Guide," for
he mentions him in the highest terms in despatch after despatch,
and at the close of the war comforts him thus: "Had
your name been Hay or Ramsay, no honors, no appointments,
no distinctions would have been considered too great to mark
the services you have rendered to Government."</p>

<p>The war ended, the Punjaub is annexed, and Hodson with
it, who loses all his appointments and returns to "the Guides."</p>

<p>He feels sore of course at the loss of his occupation and
position, but sticks to his drill-sergeant's work now that there
is nothing higher to do, and pities from his heart the dozens
of regimental officers at Peshawur who have not an hour's
work in two days. It is a recently formed station, with a flying
column of 10,000 men there for the hot months, and no
books or society; "people are pitched headlong on to their
own resources, and find them very hard falling indeed."</p>

<p>The first Sikh war had opened Hodson's eyes as to the
merits of the Sepoys; the second makes him moralize much
about the system of promotion.</p>

<p>He concludes that for war, especially in India, "your leaders
must be young to be effective," in which sentiment we heartily
agree;&mdash;but how to get them? "There are men of iron, like
Napier and Radetzky, aged men whom nothing affects; but
they are just in sufficient numbers to prove the rule by establishing
exceptions." And would not the following be ludicrous,
but that men's lives are in the balance?</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"A brigadier of infantry, under whom I served during the three
most critical days of the late war, could not see his regiment when I
led his horse by the bridle until its nose touched the bayonets; and
even then he said faintly, 'Pray which way are the men facing, Mr.
Hodson?' This is no exaggeration, I assure you. Can you wonder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
that our troops have to recover by desperate fighting, and with heavy
loss, the advantages thrown away by the want of heads and eyes to
lead them?</p>

<p>"A seniority service, like that of the Company, is all very well for
poor men; better still for fools, for they must rise equally with wise
men; but for maintaining the discipline and efficiency of the army in
time of peace, and hurling it on the enemy in war, there never was a
system which carried so many evils on its front and face."
</p>
</div>

<p>His fast friend, Sir Henry Lawrence, again intervenes, and
he is appointed an Assistant Commissioner, leaving the Guides
for a time. In this capacity, in April, 1850, he comes across
the new Commander-in-Chief:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"I have just spent three days in Sir Charles Napier's camp, it being
my duty to accompany him through such parts of the civil district as
he may have occasion to visit. He was most kind and cordial;
vastly amusing and interesting, and gave me even a higher opinion of
him than before. To be sure, his language and mode of expressing
himself savor more of the last than of this century&mdash;of the camp
than of the court; but barring these eccentricities, he is a wonderful
man; his heart is as thoroughly in his work, and he takes as high a
tone in all that concerns it, as Arnold did in his; that is to say, the
highest the subject is capable of. I only trust he will remain with us
as long as his health lasts, and endeavor to rouse the army from the
state of slack discipline into which it has fallen. On my parting with
him he said, 'Now, remember, Hodson, if there is any way in which
I can be of use to you, pray don't scruple to write to me.'"</p>
</div>

<p>After working in the Civil Service, chiefly in the Cis-Sutlej
Provinces, for nearly two years, under Mr. Edmonstone, he is
promoted to the command of the Guides on Lumsden's return
to England. The wild frontier district of Euzofzai is handed
over to him, where</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"I am military as well as civil chief; and the natural taste of the
Euzofzai Pathans for broken heads, murder, and violence, as well as
their litigiousness about their lands, keeps me very hard at work from
day to day."</p>
</div>

<p>Here he settles with his newly married wife, "the most fortunate
man in the service; and have I not a right to call
myself the happiest also, with such a wife and such a home?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<p>For nearly three years he rules this province, building a large
fort for his regiment, fighting all marauders from the hills,
training his men in all ways, even to practising their own
sports with them.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"William is very clever" his wife writes "at this," cutting an orange,
placed on a bamboo, in two, at full speed, "rarely failing. He is
grievously overworked; still his health is wonderfully good, and his
spirits as wild as if he were a boy again. He is never so well pleased
as when he has the baby in his arms."</p>
</div>

<p>Yes, the baby,&mdash;for now comes in a little episode of home
and family, a gentle and bright gem in the rough setting of
the soldier's life; and the tender and loving father and husband
stands before us as vividly as the daring border-leader.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"You would so delight in her baby tricks," he writes to his father.
"The young lady already begins to show a singularity of taste&mdash;refusing
to go to the arms of any native women, and decidedly preferring
the male population, some of whom are distinguished by her special
favor. Her own orderly, save the mark, never tires of looking at her
'beautiful white fingers,' nor she of twisting them into his black
beard,&mdash;an insult to an Oriental, which he bears with an equanimity
equal to his fondness for her. The cunning fellows have begun to
make use of her too, and when they want anything, ask the favor in
the name of Lilli B&acirc;b&acirc; (they cannot manage 'Olivia' at all). They
know the spell is potent."</p>
</div>

<p>But for the particulars of life in the wilderness, we must
refer our readers to Mrs. Hodson's letters (pp. <a href="#Page_197">197</a>-<a href="#Page_200">200</a>).
This happiness was not destined to last. In July, 1854, the
child dies.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"The deep agony of this bereavement I have no words to describe,"
the father writes. "She had wound her little being round our hearts
to an extent which we neither of us knew until we awoke from the
brief dream of beauty, and found ourselves childless."</p>
</div>

<p>Another trial too is at hand. In the autumn of 1854, Sir
H. Lawrence is removed from the Punjaub, and in October,
charges are trumped up (there is no other word for it, looking
to the result) against Hodson, in both his civil and military
capacity. A court of inquiry is appointed; and <i>before</i> that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
court has reported, he is suspended from all civil and military
duty.</p>

<p>Into the details of the charges against him we will not
enter, lest we should be tempted into the use of hard words,
which his brother has nobly refrained from. All that need be
stated is, that the sting lay in the alleged confusion of his regimental
accounts. The Court of Inquiry appointed Major
Taylor to examine these, and report on them. This was in
January, 1855; in February, 1856, Taylor presented an elaborate
report, wholly exculpating Hodson. Mr. Montgomery,
(then Commissioner for the Punjaub, now Chief Commissioner
in Oude,) to whom it was submitted, calls it the most satisfactory
report he ever read, and most triumphant. This report,
however, though made public on the spot, had not, even in
May, 1857, been communicated to the Government of India;
whether suppressed on purpose, or not, there is no evidence.
But when at last fairly brought to their notice by a remonstrance
from the accused, the satisfactory nature of the document
may be gathered from the fact that the answer is, "his
remonstrance will be placed on record for preservation, not
for justification, which it is fully admitted was not required,&mdash;no
higher testimonials were ever produced."</p>

<p>It is with the man himself that we are concerned. We
have seen him in action, and in prosperity; how will he face
disgrace and disaster?&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"I must endeavor to face the wrong, the grievous, foul wrong, with
a constant and unshaken heart, and to endure humiliation and disgrace
with as much equanimity as I may; and with the same soldierlike
fortitude with which I ought to face danger, suffering, and death in
the path of duty.... Our darling babe was taken from us on the
day my public misfortunes began, and death has robbed us of our
father before their end. The brain-pressure was almost too much for
me.... I strive to look the worst boldly in the face as I would an
enemy in the field, and to do my appointed work resolutely and to the
best of my ability, satisfied that there is a reason for all; and that
even irksome duties well done bring their own reward, and that if not,
still they are duties....</p>

<p>"It is pleasant to find that not a man who knows me has any belief
that there has been anything wrong.... Not one of them all (and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
indeed, I believe I might include my worst foes and accusers in the
category) believes that I have committed any more than errors of
judgment."</p>
</div>

<p>Thus he writes to brother and sister; and, for the rest, goes
back resolutely to his old regiment, and begins again the common
routine of a subaltern's duties, congratulating himself
that the colonel wishes to give him the adjutancy, in which
post</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"I shall have the opportunity of learning a good deal of work which
will be useful to me, and of doing, I hope, a good deal of good amongst
the men. It will be the first step up the ladder again, after tumbling
to the bottom."</p>
</div>

<p>The colonel gets him to take the office of quartermaster,
however, not the adjutancy, the former office "having fallen
into great disorder;" and in January, 1857, the honest old
officer, of his own accord, writes a letter to the Adjutant-General,
requesting him to submit to the Commander-in-Chief
"that, his public record and acknowledgment of the
essential service Lieutenant Hodson has done the regiment
at his special request;" and urging on his Excellency to
find some worthier employment for the said lieutenant. In
the same tone writes Brigadier Johnstone, commanding at
Umbala, through whom the colonel's letter had to be forwarded;
and who "trusts his Excellency will allow of his
submitting it in a more special and marked manner than by
merely countersigning; for," goes on the General, "Lieutenant
Hodson has, with patience, perseverance, and zeal, undertaken
and carried out the laborious minor duties of the regimental
staff, as well as those of a company; and with a diligence,
method, and accuracy, such as the best trained regimental
officers have never surpassed."</p>

<p>We sympathize entirely with the editor, when he bursts out,
"I know nothing in my brother's whole career more truly
admirable, or showing more real heroism, than his conduct at
this period, while battling with adverse fates."</p>

<p>But there was now no need of letters from generals or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
colonels (however acceptable such testimonies might be in
themselves) to restore Hodson to his proper position, for the
mutterings of the great eruption are already beginning to be
heard, and the ground is heaving under the feet of the
English in India.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"We are in a state of some anxiety, owing to the spread of a very
serious spirit of disaffection among the Sepoy army. It is our great
danger in India, and Lord Hardinge's prophecy, that our biggest fight
in India would be with our own army, seems not unlikely to be realized,
and that before long. Native papers, education, and progress,
are against keeping 200,000 native mercenaries in hand."</p>
</div>

<p>This is not the exact time a sane Commander-in-Chief,
looking about for helpful persons, should choose for letting a
certain Lieutenant Hodson, lately under a cloud, but, we hear,
a smart officer, and of great knowledge concerning, and
influence with natives, out of our reach. So thinks General
Anson about the 5th of May, 1857, when Hodson, out of all
patience at finding that Taylor's report has never reached the
authorities at Calcutta, applies to him for leave to go to Calcutta
to clear himself. However, by this time the ill-used
lieutenant can afford to joke about his own misfortunes, and
writes,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"There were clearly three courses open to me, '&agrave; la Sir Robert
Peel.'</p>

<p>"1st. Suicide.</p>

<p>"2d. To resign the service in disgust, and join the enemy.</p>

<p>"3d. To make the Governor-General eat his words, and apologize.</p>

<p>"I chose the last.</p>

<p>"The first was too melodramatic and foreign; the second would
have been a triumph to my foes in the Punjaub; besides, the enemy
might have been beaten!</p>

<p>"I have determined, therefore, on a trip to Calcutta."</p>
</div>

<p>Wherefore General Anson has interviews with this outrageous
lieutenant; is "most polite, even cordial," and "while
approving of my idea of going down to Calcutta, and thinking
it plucky to undertake a journey of two thousand five hundred
miles in such weather," thinks "I had better wait till I hear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
again from him, for he will himself write to Lord Canning,
and try to get justice done me."</p>

<p>In six days from this time India is in a blaze.</p>

<p>With the news of the outbreak come orders to the 1st
European Fusileers to move down to Umbala, on the route to
Delhi. They march the sixty miles in less than two days, but,
on their arrival, find an unsatisfactory state of things:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Here," writes Hodson, "alarm is the prevalent feeling, and conciliation,
of men with arms in their hands and in a state of absolute
rebellion, the order of the day. This system, if pursued, is far more
dangerous than anything the Sepoys can do to us. I do trust the
authorities will act with vigor, else there is no knowing where the
affair will end. Oh, for Sir Charles now! The times are critical, but
I have no fear of aught save the alarm and indecision of our rulers."</p>
</div>

<p>The Commander-in-Chief arrives, and now, to Hodson's
most na&iuml;ve astonishment, which breaks out in the comicalest
way in his letters, he regains all he has ever lost by one leap.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"<i>May 17th.</i>&mdash;Yesterday, I was sent for by the Commander-in-Chief,
and appointed Assistant Quartermaster-General on his personal staff,
to be under the immediate orders of his Excellency, and with command
to raise one hundred horse and fifty foot, for service in the Intelligence
Department, and as personal escort. All this was done, moreover,
in a most complimentary way, and it is quite in my line."</p>
</div>

<p>We can see clearly enough, from our own point of view,
what has been at work for a lieutenant lately under a cloud.
The plot thickens apace.</p>

<p>But who, at this juncture, will open the road to Meerut,
from the general in command of which place we want papers
and intelligence? The following extract from the letter of
an officer stationed at that place will, perhaps, explain:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"When the mutiny broke out, our communications were completely
cut off. One night, on outlying picket at Meerut, this subject being
discussed, I said, 'Hodson is at Umbala, I know; and I'll bet he will
force his way through, and open communications with the Commander-in-Chief
and ourselves.' At about three that night I heard
my advanced sentries firing. I rode off to see what was the matter,
and they told me that a party of the enemy's cavalry had approached
their post. When day broke, in galloped Hodson. He had left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
Kurn&acirc;l (seventy-six miles off) at nine the night before, with one led
horse and an escort of Sikh cavalry, and, as I had anticipated, here he
was with despatches for Wilson. How I quizzed him for approaching
an armed post at night without knowing the parole. Hodson rode
straight to Wilson, had his interview, a bath, breakfast, and two
hours' sleep, and then rode back the seventy-six miles, and had to
fight his way for about thirty miles of the distance."</p>
</div>

<p>The pace pleased the general, Hodson supposes, for "he
ordered me to raise a corps of Irregular Horse, and appointed
me Commandant," but "still no tidings from the hills," (where
his wife is;) "this is a terrible additional pull upon one's
nerves at a time like this, and is a phase of war I never
calculated on."</p>

<p>On the 27th of May the march towards Delhi begins, and
Hodson accompanies, acting as Assistant Quartermaster-General
attached to the Commander-in-Chief, "with free access to
him at any time, and to other people in authority, which gives
me power for good. The Intelligence Department is mine exclusively,
and I have for this line Sir Henry's old friend, the
one-eyed Moulvie, Rujub Alee, so I shall get the best news in
the country." He starts, too, happy about his wife from whom
he has heard; the hill stations all safe, and likely to remain so.</p>

<p>General Anson dies of cholera, and General Barnard succeeds;
still, oddly enough, no change takes place in our lieutenant's
appointments. And so the little army marches, all too
slowly, as the lieutenant thinks and remonstrates, upon Delhi.
Other men are answering to the pressure of the times:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Colonel T. Seaton and the other officers have gone to Rohtuck with
the 60th Native Infantry, who, I have no doubt, will desert to a man as
soon as they get there. It is very plucky of him and the other officers
to go; and very hard of the authorities to send them; a half-hearted
measure, and very discreditable, in my opinion, to all concerned;
affording a painful contrast to Sir John Lawrence's bold and decided
conduct in this crisis. This regiment (1st Fusileers) is a credit to any
army, and the fellows are in as high spirits and heart, and as plucky
and free from croaking as possible, and really do good to the whole
force.</p>

<p>"Alfred Light doing his work manfully and well.... Montgomery
has come out very, very strong indeed; but many are beginning to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
knock up already, and this is but the beginning of this work, I fear;
and before this business ends, we who are, thank God, still young and
strong, shall alone be left in camp; all the elderly gentlemen will
sink under the fatigue and exposure."</p>
</div>

<p><i>June 5th.</i>&mdash;Head-quarters arrive at Aleepore, nearly at the
end of our march, in fact one may say at the end, for on that day
I rode right up to the Delhi parade-ground to reconnoitre, and
the few sowars whom I met galloped away like mad at the sight
of one white face. "Had I had a hundred Guides with me I
would have gone up to the very walls;" and on June the 8th
we occupy our position before Delhi, having driven the enemy
out of their position; not without loss, for Colonel Chester is
killed, Alfred Light (who won the admiration of all) wounded....
No one else of the staff party killed or wounded; but
our general returns will, I fear, tell a sad tale. I am mercifully
unhurt, and write this line in pencil on the top of a drum
to assure you thereof.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>We must break the narrative here for a moment, now that
we have got the combatants face to face, in the place of decision,
to submit to our readers our own conviction that this same
siege of Delhi, beginning on June 9th and ending triumphantly
on September 22d, 1857, is <i>the</i> feat of arms of
which England has most cause to be proud. From Cressy to
Sebastopol it has never been equalled. A mere handful of
Englishmen, for half the time numbering less than three thousand,
sat down in the open field, in the worst days of an Indian
summer, without regular communications, (for the daks were
only got carried by bribery, stage by stage,) without proper
artillery, and last and worst of all, without able leading, before
and took a city larger than Glasgow, garrisoned by an army
trained by Englishmen, and numbering at first 20,000, in
another ten days 37,000, and at last 75,000 men, supplied with
all but exhaustless munitions of war, and in the midst of a nation
in arms. "I venture to aver," writes Hodson, "that no
other nation in the world would have remained here, or have
avoided defeat, had they attempted to do so." We agree with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
him; and we do trust that the nation will come to look at the
siege of Delhi in the right light, and properly to acknowledge
and reward the few who remain of that band of heroes who
saved British India.</p>

<p>Our readers must also remember that we are not giving the
story of the siege, but the story of Hodson's part therein, and
must therefore not think we are unduly putting him forward to
the depreciation of other as glorious names. We would that
we had the same means of following the life day by day of
Nicholson and Chamberlain, Tombs and Light, Welchman,
Showers, Home, Salkeld, or a hundred others equally gallant.
But what we have is Hodson's life compiled from his daily letters
to his wife. No doubt the work of the regulars was as
important, perhaps even more trying, than that of the Captain
of Irregular Cavalry, Assistant Quartermaster-General, and
head of the Intelligence Department; but these were his duties,
and not the others', and we shall now see how he fulfilled
them.</p>

<p>On the first day of the siege "the Guides" march into
camp:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"It would have done your heart good to see the welcome they gave
me&mdash;cheering and shouting and crowding round me like frantic creatures.
They seized my bridle, dress, hands, and feet, and literally
threw themselves down before the horse with the tears streaming
down their faces. Many officers who were present hardly knew what
to make of it, and thought the creatures were mobbing me; and so
they were&mdash;but for joy, not for mischief."</p>
</div>

<p>"Burrah Serai-wallah," they shouted, ("great in battle" in
the vulgar tongue,) making the staff and others open their eyes,
who do not much believe, for their part, in the power of any
Englishman really to attach to himself any native rascals.</p>

<p>Next day, June 10th, the ball opens. The mutineers march
out in force and attack our position:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"I had command of all the troops on our right, the gallant Guides
among the rest. They followed me, with a cheer for their old commander,
and behaved with their usual pluck, and finally we drove
the enemy in with loss.... Indeed, I did <i>not</i> expose myself unnecessarily;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
for having to direct the movements of three or four regiments,
I could not be in the front as much as I wished."</p>
</div>

<p>But wives will be anxious, my lieutenant, and making all
just allowances, it must be confessed that you give her fair
cause:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"The warmth of the reception again given me by the Guides was
quite affecting, and has produced a great sensation in camp, and had
a good effect on our native troops, insomuch that they are more willing
to obey their European officers when they see their own countrymen's
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"My position is Assistant Quartermaster-General on the Commander-in-Chief's
personal staff. I am responsible for the Intelligence Department,
and in the field, or when anything is going on for directing
the movements of the troops in action, under the immediate orders of
the general."</p>
</div>

<p>Again, on June 12th, we are at it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"A sharp fight for four hours, ending as usual. They have never
yet been so punished as to-day. The Guides behaved admirably, so
did the Fusileers as usual. I am vexed much at the <i>Lahore Chronicle
butter</i>, and wish people would leave me alone in the newspapers. The
best butter I get is the deference and respect I meet with from all
whose respect I care for, and the affectionate enthusiasm of the
Guides, which increases instead of lessening."</p>
</div>

<p>But this daily repulsing attacks cannot be allowed to go on:
cannot we have something to say to attacking them? So the
general thinks, and sets Greathed, assisted by me and two
more engineers, to submit a plan for taking Delhi.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"We drew up our scheme and gave it to the general, who highly
approved, and will, I trust, carry it out; but how times must be
changed, when four subalterns are called upon to suggest a means of
carrying out so vitally important an enterprise as this, one on which
the safety of the empire depends!"</p>
</div>

<p>Simple but "perfectly feasible" plan of four subalterns:
blow open gates with powder, and go in with bayonet, and that
there may be no mistake about it, I volunteer to lead the assault
(wholly unmindful of that assurance given to a loving heart in
the hills that I am <i>not</i> exposing myself) and fix on a small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
building in front of the gate as the rendezvous, which is now
called "Hodson's Mosque."</p>

<p>General approves, and orders assault for the morning of
June 13th. Alas for our "perfectly feasible" plan!</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"We were to have taken Delhi by assault last night, but a 'mistake
of orders' (?) as to the right time of bringing the troops to the
rendezvous prevented its execution. I am much annoyed and disappointed
at our plan not having been carried out, because I am confident
it would have been successful. The rebels were cowed, and
perfectly ignorant of any intention of so bold a stroke on our part as
an assault; the surprise would have done everything."</p>
</div>

<p>Next day there is another fight. A council of war. Our
plan is still approved, but put off from day to day. Abandoned
at last, we are to wait for reinforcements. Poor "feasible
plan!"</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"It was frustrated the first night by the fears and absolute disobedience
of orders of &mdash;&mdash;, the man who first lost Delhi, and has now
by folly prevented its being recaptured. The general has twice since
wished and even ordered it, but has always been thwarted by some
one or other; latterly by that old woman &mdash;&mdash;, who has come here for
nothing apparently but as an obstacle; &mdash;&mdash; is also a crying evil to
us. The general knows this and wants to get rid of him, but has not
the nerve to supersede him. The whole state of affairs here is bad to
a degree."</p>
</div>

<p>And here I am (June 19th), with fights going on every day,
knocked down with bronchitis and inflammation of the chest,
"really very ill for some hours." "The general nurses me as
if I were his son. I woke in the night and found the kind
old man by my bedside covering me carefully up from the
draught." But on June 20th (bronchitis notwithstanding) I
am up and at work again, for the Sepoys have attacked our
rear to-day, and though beaten as usual, Colonel Becher
(Quartermaster-General) is shot through right arm, and Daly
(commanding Guides) hit through the shoulder. So the whole
work of the Quartermaster-General's office is on me, and the
general begs me as a personal favor to take command of
Guides in addition. I at first refused, but the general was
most urgent, putting it on the ground that the service was at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
stake, and none was so fit, &amp;c. &amp;c. I do feel that we are
bound to do our best just now to put things on a proper footing;
and after consulting Seaton and Norman, I accepted the
command. How &mdash;&mdash; will gnash his teeth to see me leading
my dear old Guides again in the field.</p>

<p>And so we fight on, literally day by day, for now "our artillery
officers themselves say they are outmatched by these
rascals in accuracy and rapidity of fire; and as they have
unlimited supplies of guns, &amp;c., they are quite beyond us in
many respects. We are, in point of fact, reduced to merely
holding our own ground till we get more men." Still we don't
feel at all like giving in.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"The wounded generally are doing well, poor fellows, considering
the heat, dirt, and want of any bed but the dry ground. Their pluck
is wonderful, and it is not in the field alone that you see what an
English soldier is made of. One poor fellow who was smoking his
pipe and laughing with the comrade by his side, was asked, what was
the matter with him, and he answered in a lively voice, 'Oh, not
much, Sir, only a little knock on the back; I shall be up and at the
rascals again in a day or two.' He had been shot in the spine, and
all his lower limbs were paralyzed. He died next day. Colonel
Welchman is about again; too soon, I fear, but there is no keeping
the brave old man quiet. Poor Peter Brown is very badly wounded,
but he is cheerful, and bears up bravely. Jacob has 'come out'
wonderfully. He is cool, active, and bold, keeps his wits about him
under fire, and does altogether well. We are fortunate in having him
with the force. Good field-officers are very scarce indeed; I do not
wonder at people at a distance bewailing the delay in the taking of
Delhi. No one not on the spot can appreciate the difficulties in the
way, or the painful truth, that those difficulties increase upon us."</p>
</div>

<p>I am rather out of sorts still myself, also. It is a burden to
me to stand or walk, and the excessive heat makes it difficult
for me to recover from that sharp attack of illness. "The
doctors urge me to go away for a little, to get strength&mdash;as if
I could leave just now, or as if I would if I could." ... So I
am in the saddle all day, (June 24th,) though obliged occasionally
to rest a bit where I can find shelter, and one halt is
by Alfred Light.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"It does me good to see the 'Light of the ball-room' working away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
at his guns, begrimed with dust and heat, ever cheery and cool,
though dead beat from fatigue and exposure. How our men fought
to-day; liquid fire was no name for the fervent heat; but nothing less
than a knock-down blow from sun, sword, or bullet, stops a British
soldier."</p>
</div>

<p>My glorious old regiment! how they have suffered in this
short three weeks; Colonel Welchman badly hit in the arm,
Greville down with fever, Wriford with dysentery, Dennis
with sunstroke, Brown with wounds.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Jacob and the 'boys' have all the work to themselves, and well
indeed do the boys behave&mdash;with a courage and coolness which
would not disgrace veterans. Little Tommy Butler, Owen, Warner,
all behave like heroes, albeit with sadly diminishing numbers to lead.
Neville Chamberlain is come in, who ought to be worth a thousand
men to us."</p>
</div>

<p>Those rascals actually came out to-day (June 25th), in their
red coats and medals!</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"We are not very well off, <i>quant &agrave; la cuisine</i>. I never had so much
trouble in getting anything fit to eat, except when I dine with the
general. Colonel Seaton lives in my tent, and is a great companion;
his joyous disposition is a perpetual rebuke to the croakers."</p>
</div>

<p>And so too was your own, my Lieutenant, for we have fortunately
a letter from a distinguished officer, in which he
says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Affairs at times looked very queer, from the frightful expenditure
of life. Hodson's face was then like sunshine breaking through the
dark clouds of despondency and gloom that would settle down occasionally
on all but a few brave hearts, England's worthiest sons, who
were determined to conquer."</p>
</div>

<p>But this siege does set one really thinking in earnest about
several things, and this is the conclusion at which our Lieutenant
arrives:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"There is but one rule of action for a soldier in the field, as for a
man at all times, to do that which is best for the public good; to
make that your sole aim, resting assured that the result will in the
end be best for individual interest also. I am quite indifferent not to
see my name appear in newspaper paragraphs and despatches; only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
content if I can perform my duty truly and honestly, and too thankful
to the Almighty if I am daily spared for future labors or future
repose."</p>
</div>

<p>But here is another coil this June 27th:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"There has been an outcry throughout the camp at &mdash;&mdash;'s having
fled from Bhagput, the bridge which caused me so much hard riding
and hard work to get, some time ago."</p>
</div>

<p>He has actually bolted, on a report of mutineers coming,
leaving boats, bridge, and all. By this conduct he has lost our
communication with Meerut, and that too when our reinforcements
were actually in sight. The consequence is that I have to
go down to Bhagput to recover boats, bridge, &amp;c., and reopen
communication, which is done at once and satisfactorily; and
by July 2d we are quite comfortable, for I have set myself up
with plates, &amp;c., for one rupee, and Colonel Seaton's traps and
servants will be here to-day ... except that we are somewhat
vexed in our spirits, for</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"&mdash;&mdash; has been shelved and allowed to get sick, to save him from
supersession. I do not like euphuisms. In these days men and
things should be called by their right names, that we might know
how far either should be trusted.</p>

<p>"<i>July 5th.</i>&mdash;General Barnard dies of cholera after a few hours' illness.
Personally I am much grieved, for no kinder or more considerate
or gentlemanly man ever lived. I am so sorry for his son, a fine
brave fellow, whose attention to his father won the love of us all. It
was quite beautiful to see them together."</p>
</div>

<p>And so we plunge on day after day, the rain nearly flooding
us out of camp. Will the ladies in the hills make us some
flannel shirts?</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"The soldiers bear up like men, but the constant state of wet is no
small addition to what they have to endure from heat, hard work, and
fighting. I know by experience what a comfort a dry flannel shirt
is.</p>

<p>"<i>July 12th.</i>&mdash;Three hundred of my new regiment arrive; very fine-looking
fellows, most of them. I am getting quite a little army under
me, what with the Guides and my own men. Would to Heaven they
would give us something more to do than this desultory warfare,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
which destroys our best men, and brings us no whit nearer Delhi, and
removes the end of the campaign to an indefinite period."</p>
</div>

<p>Another fight this 14th July, one of the sharpest we have
yet had, and we who have to lead were obliged to expose ourselves,
but really not more than we could help; and how the
papers can have got hold of this wound story I can't think, for
I didn't tell it even to you. The facts are thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"A rascally Pandy made a thrust at my horse, which I parried,
when he seized his 'tulwar' in both hands, bringing it down like a
sledge-hammer; it caught on the iron of my antigropelos legging,
which it broke into the skin, cut through the stirrup-leather, and took
a slice off my boot and stocking; and yet, wonderful to say, the sword
did not penetrate the skin. Both my horse and myself were staggered
by the force of the blow, but I recovered myself quickly, and I don't
think that Pandy will ever raise his 'tulwar' again."</p>
</div>

<p>But, to show you that I did no more than was necessary, I
must tell you what Chamberlain had to do, who led in another
part.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Seeing a hesitation among the troops he led, who did not like the
look of a wall lined with Pandies, and stopped short, instead of going
up to it, he leaped his horse clean over the wall into the midst of
them, and dared the men to follow, which they did, but he got a ball
in the shoulder."</p>
</div>

<p>I must positively give up the Quartermaster-General's work;
head-quarters' staff seems breaking down altogether. General
Reed goes to the hills to-night; Congreve and Curzon
have been sent off, too; Chamberlain and Becher on their
backs with wounds.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Colonel Young, Norman, and myself, are therefore the only representatives
of the head-quarters' staff, except the doctors and commissaries.
I am wonderfully well, thank God! and able to get
through as much work as any man; but commanding two regiments,
and being eyes and ears to the whole army, too, is really too much."</p>
</div>

<p>Again, to-day (July 19) a sharp fight; Pandies in great
force&mdash;driven pellmell up to the walls; but how about getting
back.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"We were commanded by a fine old gentleman, who might sit for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
a portrait of Falstaff, so fat and jolly is he, Colonel Jones, of 60th
Rifles."</p>
</div>

<p>Jolly old Briton, with the clearest possible notion of going
on, but as for retiring, little enough idea of that sort of work
in Colonel Jones.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"The instant we began to draw off, they followed us, their immense
numbers giving them a great power of annoyance at very slight cost
to themselves. The brave old colonel was going to retire 'all of a
heap,' infantry, guns, and all in a helpless mass, and we should have
suffered cruel loss in those narrow roads, with walls and buildings on
both sides. I rode up to him and pointed this out, and in reply received
<i>carte blanche</i> to act as I saw best. This was soon done, with
the assistance of Henry Vicars (Adjutant 61st) and Coghill (Adjutant
2d Bengal European Fusileers), both cool soldiers under fire,
though so young, and we got off in good order and with trifling loss,
drawing the men back slowly, and in regular order, covered by Dixon's
and Money's guns."</p>
</div>

<p>This colonel, too, with no notion of retreating, is a candid
man; goes straight to the general on his return, and begs to
thank our Lieutenant, and to say he hopes for no better aid
whenever he has to lead; unlike some persons under whom
we have served.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"The general has begged me to give up the Guides, and not the
quartermaster-general's office. You, at least, will rejoice that it
greatly diminishes the risk to life and limb, which, I confess, lately
has been excessive in my case."</p>
</div>

<p>News of Wheeler's surrender&mdash;of the massacre four days
later (July 26), and our blood is running fire. "There will
be a day of reckoning for these things, and a fierce one, or I
have been a soldier in vain." Another fight on the 24th, and
Seaton down with chest-wound, but doing well; "he is patient
and gentle in suffering as a woman, and this helps his
recovery wonderfully." ... Thanks for the flannel waistcoats;
but as for you and Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; coming to camp as nurses, no.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Unless any unforeseen emergency should arise, I would strongly
dissuade any lady from coming to camp. They would all very
speedily become patients in the very hospitals which they came to
serve, and would so willingly support. The flannel garments are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
invaluable, and this is all that can be done for us by female hands at
present.... You say there is a great difference between doing one's
duty and running unnecessary risks, and you say truly; the only
question, what is one's duty. Now, I might, as I have more than
once, see things going wrong at a time and place when I might be
merely a spectator, and not 'on duty,' or ordered to be there, and I
might feel that by exposing myself to danger for a time I might rectify
matters, and I might therefore think it right to incur that danger;
and yet, if I were to get hit, it would be said 'he had no business
there;' nor should I, as far as the rules of the service go, though, in
my own mind, I should have been satisfied that I was right. These
are times when every man should do his best, his utmost, and not say,
'No; though I see I can do good there, yet, as I have not been ordered
and am not on duty, I will not do it.' This is not my idea of
a soldier's duty, and hitherto the results have proved me right."</p>
</div>

<p><i>August 3d.</i>&mdash;Rumor that Sir Henry is dead at Lucknow.
The news has quite unnerved me. 5th.&mdash;Nana Sahib, the
murderer (you remember the man at the artillery review, a
"swell" looking native gentleman, who spoke French, and
was talking a good deal to Alfred Light), has been beaten by
Havelock, they say has drowned himself.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"I hope it is not true; for it is one of my aims to have the catching
of the said Nana myself. The hanging him would be a positive
pleasure to me.... Nicholson has come on ahead of our reinforcements
from the Punjaub; a host in himself, if he does not go and get
knocked over as Chamberlain did.</p>

<p>"General Wilson has been down for some days, but is now better,
but nervous and over-anxious about trifles.... These men are,
personally, as brave as lions, but they have not big hearts or heads
enough for circumstances of serious responsibility....</p>

<p>"<i>August 11th.</i>&mdash;Talking of jealousies, one day, under a heavy fire,
Captain &mdash;&mdash; came up to me, and begged me to forget and forgive
what had passed, and only to remember that we were soldiers fighting
together in a common cause. As I was the injured party, I could
afford to do this. The time and place, as well as his manner, appealed
to my better feelings, so I held out my hand at once. Nowadays,
we must stand by and help each other, forget all injuries, and
rise superior to them, or God help us! we should be in terrible
plight."</p>

<p><i>August 12th</i>.&mdash;A brilliant affair under Showers; four guns
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
taken. Brave young Owen wounded, "riding astride one
gun, and a soldier with musket and fixed bayonet riding each
horse, the rest cheering like mad things. I was in the thick
of it, <i>by accident</i>."</p>
</div>

<p>By this time, Pandy, having been beaten severely in twenty-three
fights, has had nearly enough of it, and is very chary of
doing more than firing long shots, so there is no longer so
much need of our Lieutenant in camp. He may surely be
useful in clearing the neighborhood and restoring British rule
and order; so we find him starting for Rohtuck, on 17th August,
with three hundred men and five officers,&mdash;all his own
men, and first-rate,&mdash;and Macdowell, two Goughs, Ward, and
Wise. On the 18th the inhabitants send supplies and fair
words, but there is a body of a thousand infantry and three
hundred horse close by, who must be handled. Accordingly,
they are drawn into the open by a feigned retreat, and come
on firing and yelling in crowds.</p>

<p>"Threes about and at them;" five parties, each headed
by an officer, are upon them. "Never was such a scatter;
they fled as if not the Guides and Hodson's Horse, but death
and the devil, were at their heels." Only eight of my men
touched. This will encourage my new hands, utterly untrained.</p>

<p>Another skirmish, and now&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"In three days we have frightened away and demoralized a force
of artillery, cavalry, and infantry, some two thousand strong, beat
those who stood or returned to fight us, twice, in spite of numbers,
and got fed and furnished forth by the rascally town itself. Moreover,
we have thoroughly cowed the whole neighborhood, and given
them a taste of what more they will get unless they keep quiet in
future.... This is a terribly egotistical detail, and I am thoroughly
ashamed of saying so much of myself; but you insisted on having a
full, true, and particular account, so do not think me vainglorious."</p>
</div>

<p>Next come orders, but sadly indefinite ones, to look out for
and destroy the 10th Light Cavalry, who are out in the Jheend
district:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"He must either say distinctly 'do this or that,' and I will do it;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
or he must give me <i>carte blanche</i> to do what he wants in the most
practicable way, of which I, knowing the country, can best judge.
I am not going to fag my men and horses to death, and then be told I
have exceeded my instructions. He gives me immense credit for
what I have done, but 'almost wishes I had not ventured so far.' The
old gentleman means well, but does not understand either the country
or the position I was in, nor does he appreciate a tenth part of the
effects which our bold stroke at Rohtuck, forty-five miles from camp,
has produced. '<i>N'importe</i>,' they will find it out sooner or later. I
hear both Chamberlain and Nicholson took my view of the case, and
supported me warmly.... I foresee that I shall remain a subaltern,
and the easy-going majors of brigade, aides-de-camp, and staff-officers
will all get brevets."</p>
</div>

<p>Too true, my Lieutenant.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"The Victoria Cross, I confess, is the highest object of my ambition,
and had I been one of Fortune's favorites, I should have had it
ere now."</p>
</div>

<p>True again.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"But, whether a lieutenant or lieutenant-general, I trust I shall continue
to do my duty to the best of my judgment and ability, as long
as strength and sense are vouchsafed to me."</p>
</div>

<p>We trust, and are on the whole by this time prepared to
hazard a prophecy, that you will so continue, whether lieutenant
or general.</p>

<p><i>August 26th.</i>&mdash;A glorious victory at Nujjufghur, by Nicholson.
I was not there. Ill in camp; worse luck.... Scouring
the country again till August 30th, when I have to receive
an emissary from Delhi to treat.</p>

<p>Sir Colin Campbell is, they say, at Calcutta, and Mansfield,
as chief of the staff; so now we may get some leading.</p>

<p>We are in Delhi at last (September 15th), but with grievous
loss. My dear old regiment (1st Fusileers) suffered out of all
proportion.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Of the officers engaged only Wriford, Wallace, and I are untouched.
My preservation (I don't like the word <i>escape</i>) was miraculous." ...</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>
</div>

<p>Nicholson dangerously hit; ten out of seventeen engineer
officers killed or wounded.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
... "'You may count our real officers on your fingers now.'</p>

<p>"<i>Sept. 16th.</i>&mdash;I grieve much for poor Jacob; we buried him and
three sergeants of the regiment, last night; he was a noble soldier.
His death has made me captain, the long wished-for goal; but I
would rather have served on as a subaltern than gained promotion thus.</p>

<p>"<i>Sept. 19th.</i>&mdash; We are making slow progress in the city. The fact
is, the troops are utterly demoralized by hard work and hard drink, I
grieve to say. For the first time in my life, I have had to see English
soldiers refuse, repeatedly, to follow their officers. Greville, Jacob,
Nicholson, and Speke were all sacrificed to this.</p>

<p>"<i>Sept. 22d.</i>&mdash;In the Royal Palace, Delhi.&mdash;I was quite unable to
write yesterday, having had a hard day's work. I was fortunate
enough to capture the King and his favorite wife. To-day, more
fortunate still, I have seized and destroyed the King's two sons and a
grandson (the famous, or rather infamous, Abu Bukt), the villains
who ordered the massacre of our women and children, and stood by
and witnessed the foul barbarity; their bodies are now lying on the
spot where those of the unfortunate ladies were exposed. I am very
tired, but very much satisfied with my day's work, and so seem all
hands."</p>
</div>

<p>This is Hodson's account of the two most remarkable exploits
in even his career. We have no space to give his own
full narrative, which he writes later, upon being pressed to do
so; or the graphic account of Macdowell, his lieutenant, which
will be found in the book, and it would be literary murder to
mutilate such gems. As to defending the shooting of the two
princes, let those do it who feel that a defence is needed, for
we believe that no Englishman, worth convincing, now doubts
as to the righteousness and policy of the act, and probably the
old Radical general-officer and M. P., who thought it his duty
to call Hodson hard names at the time, has reconsidered his
opinion. Whether he has or not, however, matters little. He
who did the deed, and is gone, cared not for hasty or false
tongues,&mdash;why should we?</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Strange," he says, "that some of those who are loudest against
me for sparing the King, are also crying out at my destroying his sons.
'Quousque tandem?' I may well exclaim. But, in point of fact, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
am quite indifferent to clamor either way. I made up my mind, at
the time, to be abused. I was convinced I was right, and when I
prepared to run the great physical risk of the attempt, I was equally
game for the moral risk of praise or blame. These have not been,
and are not times when a man who would serve his country dare hesitate,
as to the personal consequences to himself, of what he thinks his
duty."</p>
</div>

<p>"By Jove, Hodson, they ought to make you Commander-in-Chief
for this," shouts the enthusiast to whom the prisoners
were handed over. "Well, I'm glad you have got him, but I
never expected to see either him or you again," says the Commander-in-Chief,
and sits down and writes the following despatch:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"The King, who accompanied the troops for some short distance
last night, gave himself up to a party of Irregular Cavalry, whom I
sent out in the direction of the fugitives, and he is now a prisoner
under a guard of European soldiers."</p>
</div>

<p>Delhi is ours; but at what a cost in officers and men! and
Nicholson is dead.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"With the single exception of my ever revered friend, Sir Henry
Lawrence, and Colonel Mackeson, I have never met his equal in field
or council; he was pre&euml;minently our best and bravest, and his loss is
not to be atoned for in these days.</p>

<p>"The troops have behaved with singular moderation towards
women and children, considering their provocation. I do not believe,
and I have some means of knowing, that a single woman or child has
been purposely injured by our troops, and the story on which your
righteous indignation is grounded is quite false; the troops have been
demoralized by drink, but nothing more."</p>
</div>

<p>In November he gets a few weeks' leave, and is off to
Umbala to meet his wife for the last time, safe after all, and no
longer a lieutenant under a cloud. What a meeting must that
have been.</p>

<p>With the taking of Delhi our narrative, already too long,
must close, though a grand five months of heroic action
still remained. Nothing in the book exceeds in interest
the ride of ninety-four miles from Seaton's column, with
young Macdowell, to carry a despatch to Sir Colin, on December
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
30th. The tale of the early morning summons, the
rumors of enemies on the road, the suspense as to the Chief's
whereabouts, the leaving all escort behind, their flattering and
cordial reception by Sir Colin, (who gets them "chops and
ale in a quiet friendly way,") the fifty-four miles' ride home,
the midnight alarm and escape, and the safe run in, take away
our breath. And the finish is inimitable.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"All Hodson said," writes Macdowell, "when we were at Bewar,
and safe, was 'By George! Mac, I'd give a good deal for a cup of
tea,' and immediately went to sleep. He is the coolest hand I have
ever yet met. We rode ninety-four miles. Hodson rode seventy-two
on one horse, the little dun, and I rode Alma seventy-two miles also."</p>
</div>

<p>One more anecdote, however, we cannot resist. On the
6th of January, 1858, Seaton's column joins the Commander-in-Chief;
on the 27th, at Shumshabad, poor young Macdowell
(whose letters make one love him) is killed, and Hodson badly
wounded. They were in advance, as usual, with guns, and
had to charge a superior body of cavalry:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"But there was nothing for it but fighting, as, had we not attacked
them, they would have got in amongst our guns. We were only three
officers, and about one hundred and eighty horsemen,&mdash;my poor
friend and second in command, Macdowell, having received a mortal
wound a few minutes before we charged. It was a terrible <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> for
some time, and we were most wonderfully preserved. However, we
gave them a very proper thrashing, and killed their leaders. Two
out of the three of us were wounded, and five of my men killed and
eleven wounded, besides eleven horses. My horse had three sabre-cuts,
and I got two, which I consider a rather unfair share. The
Commander-in-Chief is very well satisfied, I hear, with the day's
work, and is profusely civil and kind to me."</p>
</div>

<p>In another letter he writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"They were very superior in number, and individually so as horsemen
and swordsmen, but we managed to 'whop' them all the same,
and drive them clean off the field; not, however, until they had made
two very pretty dashes at us, which cost us some trouble and very
hard fighting. It was the hardest thing of the kind in which I ever
was engaged in point of regular '<i>in</i> fighting,' as they say in the
P. R.; only <i>Bell's Life</i> could describe it properly. I got a cut,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
which laid my thumb open, from a fellow after my sword was through
him, and about half an hour later this caused me to get a second severe
cut, which divided the muscles of the right arm, and put me
<i>hors de combat</i>; for my grip on the sword-handle was weakened, and
a demon on foot succeeded in striking down my guard, or rather his
tulwar glanced off my guard on to my arm. My horse, also, got three
cuts. I have got well most rapidly, despite an attack of erysipelas,
which looked very nasty for three days, and some slight fever; and I
have every reason to be thankful."</p>
</div>

<p>He is able, notwithstanding wounds, to accompany the
forces, Colonel Burn kindly driving him in his dog-cart.
Nothing could exceed Sir Colin's kind attentions. Here is a
chief, at last, who can appreciate a certain captain, late lieutenant
under a cloud. The old chief drinks his health as
colonel, and, on Hodson's doubting, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"<i>I</i> will see that it is all arranged; just make a memorandum of
your services during the Punjaub war, and I venture to prophesy that
it will not be long before I shake hands with you as Lieutenant-Colonel
Hodson, C.B., with a Victoria Cross to boot."</p>
</div>

<p>By the end of February he is well, and in command of his
regiment again, and in his last fight saves the life of his adjutant,
Lieut. Gough, by cutting down a rebel trooper in the very
act of spearing him.</p>

<p>And now comes the end. For a week the siege had gone
on, and work after work of the enemy had fallen. On the
11th of March the Begum's Palace was to be assaulted. Hodson
had orders to move his regiment nearer to the walls, and
while choosing a spot for his camp heard firing, rode on, and
found his friend Brigadier Napier directing the assault. He
joined him, saying, "I am come to take care of you; you
have no business to go to work without me to look after you."
They entered the breach together, were separated in the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i>,
and in a few minutes Hodson was shot through the chest. The
next morning the wound was declared to be mortal, and he
sent for Napier to give his last instructions.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"He lay on his bed of mortal agony," says this friend, "and met
death with the same calm composure which so much distinguished
him on the field of battle. He was quite conscious and peaceful, occasionally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
uttering a sentence, 'My poor wife,' 'My poor sisters.' 'I
should have liked to have seen the end of the campaign and gone
home to the dear ones once more, but it was so ordered.' 'It is hard
to leave the world just now, when success is so near, but God's will
be done.' 'Bear witness for me that I have tried to do my duty to
man. May God forgive my sins, for Christ's sake.' 'I go to my
Father.' 'My love to my wife,&mdash;tell her my last thoughts were of
her.' 'Lord receive my soul.' These were his last words, and without
a sigh or struggle his pure and noble spirit took its flight."</p>
</div>

<p>"It was so ordered." They were his own words; and now
that the first anguish of his loss is over, will not even those
nearest and dearest to him acknowledge "it was ordered for
the best?" For is there not something painful to us in calculating
the petty rewards which we can bestow upon a man who
has done any work of deliverance for his country? Do we
not almost dread&mdash;eagerly as we may desire his return&mdash;to
hear the vulgar, formal phrases which are all we can devise to
commemorate the toils and sufferings that we think of with
most gratitude and affection? There is somewhat calming
and soothing in the sadness which follows a brave man to his
grave in the very place where his work was done, just when it
was done. Alas, but it is a bitter lesson to learn, even to us
his old schoolfellows, who have never seen him since we parted
at his "leaving breakfast." May God make us all braver and
truer workers at our own small tasks, and worthy to join him,
the hard fighter, the glorious Christian soldier and Englishman,
when our time shall come.</p>

<p>On the next day, March 13th, he was carried to a soldier's
grave, in the presence of the head-quarters, staff, and of Sir
Colin, his last chief, who writes thus to his widow:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"I followed your noble husband to the grave myself, in order to
mark, in the most public manner, my regret and esteem for the most
brilliant soldier under my command, and one whom I was proud to
call my friend."</p>
</div>

<p>What living Englishman can add one iota to such praise
from such lips? The man of whom the greatest of English
soldiers could thus speak, needs no mark of official approbation,
though it is a burning disgrace to the authorities that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
none such has been given. But the family which mourns its
noblest son may be content with the rewards which his gallant
life and glorious death have won for him and them,&mdash;we believe
that he himself would desire no others. For his brothers-in-arms
are erecting a monument to him in Lichfield Cathedral;
his schoolfellows are putting up a window to him, and the other
Rugb&aelig;ans who have fallen with him, in Rugby Chapel; and
the three regiments of Hodson's Horse will hand down his
name on the scene of his work and of his death as long as
Englishmen bear rule in India. And long after that rule has
ceased, while England can honor brave deeds and be grateful
to brave men, the heroes of the Indian mutiny will never be
forgotten, and the hearts of our children's children will leap
up at the names of Lawrence, Havelock, and Hodson.</p>

<h2 class="p6">PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION.</h2>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>I have now been able to complete the series of
extracts from my brother's letters, down to the
morning of the fatal 11th March. The greater
portion of the Fourth Chapter of Part II. will be
found to have been added since the first edition.</p>

<p>I have to apologize for an inaccuracy in the
quotation which I gave from Sir Colin Campbell's
letter on the occasion of my brother's death. A
correct copy of the letter in full will be found at
page <a href="#Page_431">431</a>. I have not found it necessary to make
any other corrections of importance. Cases have
been pointed out to me, in which officers who
took part in different operations described, and
did good service, are not mentioned by name;
but I felt that I could not supply any such omissions,
without taking upon myself a responsibility
which I have disclaimed.</p>

<p>It was very natural that my brother, in writing
to his wife, should make especial mention of those
in whom she was interested. It is probable, too,
that in some cases, subsequent information would
have modified views expressed at the moment, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
I have adhered to the principle of giving his letters
as they were written day by day.</p>

<p>The favorable reception given to the former
editions of this work, has quite satisfied me that
I was not wrong in supposing that my brother's
character only required to be known, in order to
be estimated as it deserved, by Englishmen of
every class and profession.</p>

<h2 class="p6">PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.</h2>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>It can scarcely be needful to make any apology
for offering to the public this record of one who
has attracted to himself so large a measure of
attention and admiration. Many, both in this
country and in India, have expressed, and I doubt
not many others have felt, a desire to know more
of the commander of Hodson's Horse, and captor
of the King of Delhi and his sons.</p>

<p>My original intention was to have compiled
from my brother's letters merely an account of the
part he bore in the late unhappy war. I very
soon, however, determined to extend the work, so
as to embrace the whole of his life in India.</p>

<p>I felt that the public would naturally inquire
by what previous process of training he had acquired,
not merely his consummate skill in the
great game of war, but his experience of Asiatics
and marvellous influence over their minds.</p>

<p>The earlier portions of this book will serve to
answer such inquiries; they will show the gradual
development of my brother's character and powers,
and that those exploits which astonished the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
world by their skill and daring, were but the natural
results of the high idea of the soldier's profession
which he proposed to himself, honestly and
consistently worked out during ten years of training,
in perhaps the finest school that ever existed
for soldiers and administrators. They will explain
how it was that, in the midst of a struggle for the
very existence of our empire, he was able to call
into being and bring into the field around Delhi
an "invincible and all but ubiquitous" body of
cavalry.</p>

<p>The dragon's teeth which came up armed men,
had been sown by him long before in his earlier
career in the Punjaub. There, by many a deed of
daring and activity, by many a successful stratagem
and midnight surprise, by many a desperate
contest, he had taught the Sikhs, first to dread him
as an enemy, and then to idolize him as a leader.
Already in 1849 the Governor-General had had
"frequent occasions of noticing not only his personal
gallantry, but the activity, energy, and intelligence
with which he discharged whatever duties
were intrusted to him." Even then the name
of Hodson, although unknown in England, except
to the few who watched his course with the eyes
of affection, was a sound of terror to the Sikhs, and
a bugbear to their children. In 1852 he earned
this high praise from one best qualified to judge:
"Lieutenant Hodson, marvellously attaching the
Guides to himself by the ties of mutual honor,
mutual daring, and mutual devotion, has on every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
opportunity proved that the discipline of a public
school and subsequent University training are no
disqualification for hazardous warfare, or for the
difficult task of keeping wild tribes in check."</p>

<p>The title given to this book will sufficiently indicate
the principle on which, particularly in the
first part, I have made selections from my brother's
letters. My object has been to show what a
soldier's life in India may be, and what in his case
it was; how wide and varied is the field which it
opens for the exercise of the highest and noblest
qualities, intellectual and moral, of our nature;
and how magnificently he realized and grasped
the conception.</p>

<p>His letters, written in all the freedom of unreserved
intercourse, will give a truer notion of his
character than the most labored description; they
exhibit the undercurrent of deep feelings that ran
through even his most playful moods, the yearning
after home that mingled with the dreams of
ambition and the thirst for the excitement of war,
the almost womanly tenderness that coexisted
with the stern determination of the soldier. They
show that though his lot was cast in camps, he
was not a mere soldier; though a hanger-on on
the outskirts of civilization amidst wild tribes, he
had a keen appreciation of the refinement and
elegancies of civilized life; that though in India,
he remembered that he was an Englishman; that
though living amongst the heathen, he did not
forget that he was a Christian.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<p>I have not attempted to write a biography,
but have allowed my brother to speak for himself,
merely supplying such connecting links as
seemed absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>Indeed, I could do no otherwise; for unhappily,
during the twelve years of his soldier's life,&mdash;those
years in which his character received its mature
development,&mdash;I knew him only by his letters,
or by the reports of others; when we parted on
board the ship that carried him from England, in
1845, we parted to meet no more in this world.
My recollections of him, vivid as they are, are not
of the leader of men in council and the battle-field,
but of the bright and joyous boy, the life
of the home circle, the tender and affectionate
son, the loving brother, the valued friend, the
popular companion.</p>

<p>Of what he became afterwards my readers will
have the same means of judging as myself. He
seems to me to have been one of whom not only
his family, but his country may well be proud,&mdash;a
worthy representative of the English name and
nation amongst the tribes of India, an impersonation
of manly straightforwardness, and unhesitating
daring, and irresistible power.</p>

<p>I cannot doubt but that the verdict of his
countrymen will confirm my judgment.</p>

<p>Many too, I believe, will agree with me in
thinking that these pages prove that the poetry
and romance of war are not yet extinct, that even
the Enfield rifle has not reduced all men to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
dead level, but that there is still a place to be
found for individual prowess, for the lion heart,
and the eagle eye, and the iron will. One seems
transported back from the prosaic nineteenth century
to the ages of romance and chivalry, and to
catch a glimpse, now of a Paladin of old, now of
a knightly hero <i>sans peur et sans reproche</i>; now,
of a northern chieftain, "riding on border foray,"
now of a captain of free-lances; yet all dissolving
into a Christian soldier of our own day.</p>

<p>Most striking of all, it has appeared to me, is
the resemblance to the romantic career of that
hero of the Spanish ballads, who, by his many
deeds of heroic daring, gained for himself the distinguished
title of "El de las Hazanas,"&mdash;"He
of the exploits." Those who are acquainted with
the chronicles of the Conquest of Granada, will
almost fancy in reading these pages that they are
hearing again the story of Fernando Perez del
Pulgar; how at one time by a bold dash he rode
with a handful of followers across a country
swarming with the enemy, and managed to force
his way into a beleaguered fortress; how at another
he galloped alone up the streets of Granada, then
in possession of the enemy, to the gates of the
principal mosque, and nailed a paper to the door
with his dagger; how again he turned the tide of
battle by the mere charm of his eagle eye and
thrilling voice, inspiring the most timid with a
courage equal to his own; how he made the
enemy lay down their arms at his word of command;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
how the Moorish mothers frightened their
children with the sound of his name; how he
was not only the harebrained adventurer, delighting
in peril and thirsting for the excitement of the
fight, but also the courteous gentleman, the accomplished
scholar; as profound and sagacious in
the council as he was reckless in the field, and
frequently selected by the wily Ferdinand to conduct
affairs requiring the greatest prudence and
judgment.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>It may be, however, that affection has biassed
my judgment, and that I shall be thought to have
formed an exaggerated estimate of the grandeur
and nobleness of the subject of this memoir.
Even if this be so, I shall not take much to heart
the charge of having loved such a brother too
well, and I shall console myself with the thought
that I have endeavored to do something to perpetuate
his memory.</p>

<p>If, however, any young soldier be induced, by
reading these pages, to take a higher view of his
profession, to think of it as one of the noblest
fields in which he can serve his God and his
country, and enter on it in a spirit of self-sacrifice,
with "duty" as his guiding principle, and a
determination never to forget that he is a Christian
soldier and an Englishman, I shall be abundantly
rewarded; my main object will be attained.</p>

<p class="ch_summ">EARLY LIFE.&mdash;RUGBY.&mdash;CAMBRIDGE.&mdash;GUERNSEY.</p>

<p>William Stephen Raikes Hodson, third
son of Rev. George Hodson, afterwards Archdeacon
of Stafford and Canon of Lichfield, was
born at Maisemore Court, near Gloucester, on
19th March, 1821.</p>

<p>As a boy, his affectionate disposition and bright
and joyous character endeared him greatly to his
family, and made him a general favorite with all
around him, old and young, rich and poor. That
which characterized him most was his quickness
of observation and his interest in everything going
on about him. By living with his eyes and ears
open, and never suffering anything to escape his
notice, he acquired a stock of practical knowledge
which he turned to good account in his after-life.
With the exception of a short time spent with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
private tutor, the Rev. E. Harland, he was educated
at home till he went to Rugby, in his fifteenth
year. Home life, however, had not prevented
him from growing up an active, high-spirited
boy, full of life and energy.</p>

<p>His feats of activity at Rugby still live in the
remembrance of his contemporaries and the traditions
of the school. The following is an extract
from a paper in the <i>Book of Rugby School</i>, published
in 1856:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Who does not remember the fair-haired, light-complexioned
active man whose running feats, whether in the
open fields or on the gravel walks of the Close, created
such marvel among his contemporaries. He has carried
his hare and hounds into his country's service, and as
commandant of the gallant corps of Guides, has displayed
an activity and courage on the wild frontier of the Punjaub,
the natural development of his early prowess at
Crick and Brownsover.</p>
</div>

<p>A very similar notice appeared in a periodical
during the recent campaign:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The Rugb&oelig;ans have had their Crick run. Six miles
over heavy country, there and back, to the school gates
by the road, is no mean distance to be done in one hour
twenty-nine minutes.</p>

<p>There was a day when the gallant leader of <i>Hodson's
Horse</i> always led in this run. We think we see "larky
Pritchard," as he was familiarly designated, in his blue
cloth jacket, white trousers, his well-known belt, and his
"golden hair," going in front with his nice easy stride, (for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
he never had any very great pace, though he could last
forever,) and getting back coolly and comfortably to
"Bons" when the rear hounds were toiling a mile behind.
There never was such a boy to run over, after second
lesson, to Dunchurch to see the North Warwickshire, or
to give himself a "pipe-opener" to Lutterworth and back
between callings over, till the doctor vowed he would
injure his heart. How true it is that men who have
distinguished themselves most in school sports come out
the best at last.</p>
</div>

<p>It was not, however, only in active sports that
he showed ability. As head of a house, during
the later portion of his Rugby life, he gave equal
indications of "administrative capacity."</p>

<p>His tutor, (the present Bishop of Calcutta,)
speaking of his having been transferred to his
house, in which there were then no pr&aelig;postors,
"because, from his energetic character and natural
ability, he seemed to Dr. Arnold likely to
give me efficient help," continues: "He gave
abundant proof that Arnold's choice had been a
wise one. Though he immediately re&euml;stablished
the shattered prestige of pr&aelig;positorial power, he
contrived to make himself very popular with
various classes of boys. The younger ones
found in him an efficient protector against bullying.
Those of a more literary turn found in
him an agreeable and intelligent companion, and
were fond of being admitted to sit in his study
and talk on matters of intellectual interest. The
democrats had got their master, and submitted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
with a good grace to power which they could not
resist, and which was judiciously and moderately
exercised. The <i>r&eacute;gime</i> was wise, firm, and kind,
and the house was happy and prosperous.</p>

<p>"From all that I knew of him, both at Rugby
and afterwards, I was not surprised at the courage
and coolness which the <i>Times</i> compared
'to the spirit of a Paladin of old.' I cannot say
how much I regret that I shall not be welcomed
in India by the first head of my dear old house
at Rugby."</p>

<p>From Rugby my brother went, in October,
1840, to Trinity College, Cambridge. Here, as
might have been expected from his previous
habits, he took an active interest in boating and
other athletic amusements, while at the same
time he by no means neglected the more serious
and intellectual pursuits of the University. He
had a very considerable acquaintance with, and
taste for, both classical and general literature,
but a constitutional tendency to headache very
much stood in the way of any close application
to books; and, after he had taken his degree in
1844, was one strong reason for his deciding on
an active rather than a studious life.
The Indian
army seemed to offer the best opening, but while
waiting for a cadetship, in order to prevent superannuation
he obtained, through the kind introduction
of Lord de Saumarez, a commission in
the Guernsey Militia from Major-General W.
Napier, the Lieutenant-Governor, and there commenced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
his military life. From the first he felt
that the profession of a soldier was one that
required to be studied, and took every opportunity
of mastering its principles.</p>

<p>On his leaving Guernsey to enter the Hon.
East India Company's service, Major-General
W. Napier bore this testimony to his character:
"I think he will be an acquisition to any service.
His education, his ability, his zeal to make himself
acquainted with military matters, gave me
the greatest satisfaction during his service with
the militia."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a></span></p>

<h2 class="p6">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="ch_summ">ARRIVAL IN INDIA.&mdash;CAMPAIGN ON THE SUTLEJ,
1845-46.</p>

<p>My brother landed at Calcutta on the 13th of
September, 1845, and, with as little delay as possible,
proceeded up the country to Agra, where he
found a hearty welcome beneath the hospitable
roof of the Hon. James Thomason, Lieutenant-Governor
of the Northwest Provinces, an old
family friend and connection, who, from that time
to his death, treated him with as much affection,
and took as deep an interest in his career, as if
he had been his own son.</p>

<p>He was appointed to do duty with the 2d
Grenadiers, then forming a part of the Governor-General's
escort, and, accordingly, left Agra on
November 2d. In the following letter he describes
his first impressions of camp life in an
Indian army.</p>

<p>After mentioning a delay caused by an attack
of fever and dysentery, on his way to the camp,
he proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I was able, however, to join the Grenadiers at four
o'clock on the morning of the 7th, and share their dusty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
march of ten miles to the village near which the Governor-General's
camp was pitched. Since that day we have
been denizens of a canvas city of a really astonishing extent,
seeing that it is the creation of a few hours, and
shifts with its enormous population, some ten or fifteen
miles a day. I wonder more every day at the ease and
magnitude of the arrangements, and the varied and interesting
pictures continually before our eyes. Soon after
four <span class="smcap">A. M.</span>, a bugle sounds the <i>reveille</i>, and the whole mass
is astir at once. The smoke of the evening fires has by
this time blown away, and everything stands out clear
and defined in the bright moonlight. The Sepoys, too,
bring the straw from their tents, and make fires to warm
their black faces on all sides, and the groups of swarthy
redcoats stooping over the blaze, with a white background
of canvas, and the dark clear sky behind all, produce a
most picturesque effect as one turns out into the cold.
Then the multitudes of camels, horses, and elephants, in
all imaginable groups and positions,&mdash;the groans and
cries of the former as they stoop and kneel for their burdens,
the neighing of hundreds of horses mingling with
the shouts of the innumerable servants and their masters'
calls, the bleating of sheep and goats, and louder than all,
the shrill screams of the Hindoo women, almost bewilder
one's senses as one treads one's way through the canvas
streets and squares to the place where the regiment assembles
outside the camp.</p>

<p>A second bugle sounds "the assembly." There is a
blaze of torches from the Governor's tents; his palanquin
carriage, drawn by four mules, and escorted by jingling
troopers, trots to the front. The artillery thunder
forth the morning gun, as a signal that the great man is
gone,&mdash;the guns rattle by,&mdash;the cavalry push on after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
them,&mdash;and then at length our band strikes up. "Forward"
is the word, and the red (and black) column moves
along, by this time as completely obscured by the dense
clouds of dust as though they were in London during a
November fog. We are not expected to remain with our
men, but mount at once, and ride in a cluster before the
band, or ride on a quarter of a mile or so, in twos and
threes, complaining of the laziness of the great man's
people, and of the dust and cold, as if we were the most
ill-used of her Majesty's subjects. As soon as we're off
the ground, and the road pretty clear, I dismount, and
walk the first eight miles or so, this being the time to
recover one's powers of locomotion. The cold is really
very great, especially in the hour before sunrise,&mdash;generally
about one and a half or two hours after we start. It
soon gets warm enough to make one glad to ride again,
and by the time the march is over, and the white city is
in sight, the heat is very great, though now diminishing
daily. It is a sudden change of temperature, truly,&mdash;from
near freezing at starting, to 90&deg; or 100&deg; at arriving;
and it is this, I think, which makes us feel the heat so
much in this climate. In the daytime we get on very
well; the heat seldom exceeding 86&deg;, and often not more
than 84&deg; and 82&deg; in tents. It sounds hot, but a house or
tent at 84&deg; is tolerably endurable, especially if there is a
breeze. My tent is twelve feet square inside, and contains
a low pallet bed, a table, chair, two camel trunks,
and brass basin for washing. I will get a sketch of the
camp to send you.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 18th.</i>&mdash;This nomad life is agreeable in many
respects, and very healthy, and one sees a great deal
of the country, but it destroys time rather, as the
march is not over, generally, till half-past nine or ten,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
and then breakfast, a most eagerly desired composition,
and dressing afterwards, do not leave much of the day
before the cool evening comes for exercise, or sight-seeing
and dining, and by nine most of us are in bed,
or near it.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 2.</i>&mdash;Umb&acirc;la.&mdash;We had a short march of six miles
into Umb&acirc;la this morning, and I got leave from our colonel
to ride on and see the troops assemble to greet the Governor-General.
I never saw so splendid a sight: 12,000
of the finest troops were drawn up in one line, and as I
rode slowly along the whole front, I had an excellent opportunity
of examining the varied materials of an Indian
army. First were the English Horse Artillery; then the
dashing dragoons of the 3d Queen's, most splendidly
mounted and appointed; then came the stern, determined-looking
British footmen, side by side with their tall and
swarthy brethren from the Ganges and Jumna,&mdash;the
Hindoo, the Mussulman, and the white man, all obeying
the same word, and acknowledging the same common tie;
next to these a large brigade of guns, with a mixture of
all colors and creeds; then more regiments of foot, the
whole closed up by the regiments of native cavalry:
the quiet-looking and English-dressed Hindoo troopers
strangely contrasted with the wild Irregulars in all the fanciful
<i>un</i>uniformity of their native costume; yet these last
are the men <i>I</i> fancy for service. Altogether, it was a
most interesting sight, either to the historian or soldier,
especially as one remembered that these were no men of
parade, but assembled here to be poured across the Sutlej
at a word.</p>
</div>

<p>The "pomp and circumstance" of war were
soon to be exchanged for its stern realities, as will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
be seen in the following letter to his father, dated
Christmas Day, 1845:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left65"><span class="smcap">Camp, Sultanpoor.</span></p>

<p>I take the first day of rest we have had, to write a few
hurried lines to relieve you from any anxiety you may
have felt at not hearing from me by the last mails, or
from newspaper accounts, which will, I fear, reach you
before this letter can. I am most thankful to be able to
sit down once more to write to you all but unharmed.
Since I wrote, I have been in four general engagements
of the most formidable kind ever known in India. For
the first time we had to contend with a brave and unconquered
people, disciplined, and led on like our own troops
by European skill; and the result, though successful to
our arms, has been fearful indeed as to carnage. You will
see accounts in the papers giving details more accurate
than I can possibly furnish, both of our wonderfully rapid
and fatiguing marches, and of the obstinate and bloody
resistance we met with. On the 10th of this month, on
our usual quiet march to Sirhind with the Governor-General's
camp, we were surprised by being joined by an additional
regiment, and by an order for all non-soldiers to
return to Umb&acirc;la. From that day we have had the
fatigues and exertions of actual warfare in their broadest
forms,&mdash;marching day and night unprecedented distances,
scarcity of sleep and food, and all the varieties of cold
and heat. I enjoyed all, and entered into it with great
zest, till we came to actual blows, or rather, I am (<i>now</i>)
half ashamed to say, till the blows were over, and I saw
the horrible scenes which ensue on war. I have had
quite enough of such sights now, and hope it may not be
my lot to be exposed to them again. Our loss has been
most severe, especially in officers. Our Sepoys could not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
be got to face the tremendous fire of the Sikh artillery,
and, as usual, the more they quailed, the more the English
officers exposed themselves in vain efforts to bring
them on. The greatest destruction was, however, among
the Governor-General's staff,&mdash;only two (his own son
and Colonel Benson) escaped death or severe wounds.
They seemed marked for destruction, and certainly met it
most gallantly. On the 15th we joined the Commander-in-Chief,
with his troops from Umb&acirc;la, were put off escort
duty, and joined General Gilbert's division. On the 17th
we had a march of thirty miles, (in the daytime, too,)
with scanty food; on the 18th, after a fasting march of
twenty-five miles, we were summoned, at half-past four in
the afternoon, to battle, which lasted till long after dark.
Almost the first shot which greeted our regiment killed
the man standing by my side, and instantly afterwards I
was staggered by a ball from a frightened Sepoy behind
me grazing my cheek and blackening my face with the
powder,&mdash;so close was it to my head! We were within
twenty, and at times ten, yards of three guns blazing
grape into us, and worse than all, the bushes with which
the whole ground was covered were filled with marksmen
who, unseen by us, could pick us off at pleasure. No
efforts could bring the Sepoys forward, or half the loss
might have been spared, had they rushed on with the
bayonet. We had three officers wounded out of our
small party, and lost many of the men. We were bivouacked
on the cold ground that night, and remained under
arms the whole of the following day. Just as we
were going into action, I stumbled upon poor Carey,
whom you may remember to have heard of at Price's, at
Rugby. On going over the field on the 30th, I found the
body actually cut to pieces by the keen swords of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Sikhs, and but for his clothes could not have recognized
him. I had him carried into camp for burial, poor fellow,
extremely shocked at the sudden termination of our renewed
acquaintance. On Sunday, the 21st, we marched
before daybreak in force to attack the enemy, who had
intrenched themselves behind their formidable artillery.
The action began in the afternoon, lasted the whole night,
and was renewed with daybreak. They returned again
to the charge as often as we gained any advantage, and
it was evening before they were finally disposed of by
a charge of our dragoons, <i>and our ammunition was exhausted!</i>&mdash;so
near are we in our most triumphant successes
to a destruction as complete! The results are, I
suppose, in a political point of view, immense indeed.
We took from them nearly one hundred large guns, and
routed their vast army, prepared, had they succeeded in
beating us, to overrun Hindostan; and it must be owned
they had nearly succeeded! It will scarcely be believed,
but they had actually purchased and prepared supplies as
far into the interior of our country as Delhi, and unknown
to our authorities; and the whole of Northern India was,
as usual, ready to rise upon us at an hour's notice. On
the evening of the 21st, as we rushed towards the guns,
in the most dense dust and smoke, and under an unprecedented
fire of grape, our Sepoys again gave way and
broke. It was a fearful crisis, but the bravery of the
English regiments saved us. The Colonel (Hamilton),
the greater part of my brother officers, and myself, were
left with the colors and about thirty men immediately in
front of the batteries! Our escape was most providential,
and is, I trust, thankfully acknowledged by us. A
ball (from a shell, I fancy) struck my leg below the
knee, but happily spared the bone, and only inflicted a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
flesh wound. I was also knocked down <i>twice</i>,&mdash;once by
a shell bursting so close to me as to kill the men behind
me, and once by the explosion of a magazine or mine.
I am most thankful indeed for my escape from death or
maiming. The wound in my leg is nothing, as you may
judge when I tell you that I was on foot or horseback
the whole of the two following days. Last night we
moved on here about five miles from the scene of action,
and got some food, and into our beds, after four days and
nights on the ground, alternately tried with heat and cold
(now most severe at night), and nothing but an occasional
mouthful of black native bread. I think, during the four
days, all I had to eat would not compose half a home
breakfast-loaf, and for a day and night we had not even
water; when we did get water, after driving the enemy
from their camp, it was found to have been spoiled with
gunpowder! It was like eating Leamington water, but
our thirst was too great to stick at trifles.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 26th.</i>&mdash;We are resting here comfortably again in
our tents, and had a turkey for our Christmas dinner last
night. The rest is most grateful. We had only nine
hours in bed out of five nights, and then the next four
were on the ground. So you see I have come in for the
realities of a soldier's life pretty early in my career; and
since I am spared, it is doubtless a great thing for me in
every way. There never has been anything like it in
India, and it is not often that an action <i>anywhere</i> has
lasted thirty-six hours as ours did. It is called a succession
of three engagements, but the firing never ceased for
a quarter of an hour. Infantry attacking guns was the
order of the day, and the loss occasioned by such a desperate
resort was fearful. How different your Christmas
week will have been from mine! This time last year I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
was quietly staying at Bisham, and now sleeping on the
banks of the Sutlej, with a sea of tents around me for
miles and miles! The last few days seem a year, and I
can scarcely believe that I have only been four months in
India, and only two with my regiment.</p>

<span class="smcap">Camp, Bootawallah</span>, <i>January 22d, 1846</i>.</p>

<p>There is very much in the state of things in this army
both discouraging and deeply disappointing to one who
like myself comes into the service with a strong predilection
for the profession, and a wish to enter into its duties
thoroughly and <i>earnestly</i>. I do not like to enter into particulars,
for I hold it very unmilitary, especially in so
young a soldier, to attempt to criticize the acts and motives
of one's superior, but I may <i>in private</i> again express
my extreme disappointment at the state in which
the Sepoys are at present, and as far as I can judge from
what is said in conversation, there are but few officers in
the army who do not deplore it. In discipline and subordination
they seem to be lamentably deficient, especially
towards the native commissioned and non-commissioned
officers. On the march, I have found these last give me
more trouble than the men even. My brother officers
say that I see an unfavorable specimen in the 2d, as regards
discipline, owing to their frequent service of late,
and the number of recruits; but I fear the evil is very
wide-spread. It may no doubt be traced mainly to the
want of European officers. This, however, is an evil not
likely to be removed on any large scale. Meantime, unless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
some vigorous and radical improvements take place,
I think our position will be very uncertain and even
alarming in the event of extended hostilities. You must
really forgive my speaking so plainly, and writing my
own opinions so freely. You encouraged me to do so
when I was at Agra, if you remember, and I value the
privilege too highly as connected with the greater one of
receiving advice and counsel from you, not to exercise it,
even at the risk of your thinking me presumptuous and
hasty in my opinions. I imagine (in my own defence be
it said) that three months of marching and of service give
you more insight into the <i>real</i> efficiency or evils of an
army, than a much longer time spent in cantonments. It
is, of course, a deeply interesting subject to me, and one
of deep and anxious reflection. I think the period of
"doing duty," which I shall have passed ere joining my
future regiment, of the greatest consequence and benefit,
as enabling me to form a judgment, to the best of my
abilities, of the course to be steered in the difficult voyage.
It seems to me that the great problem to be solved
is how "<i>to do your own business</i>," at the same time that
"<i>you study to be quiet</i>" <i>i.e.</i>, how unostentatiously to do
your appointed duty thoroughly, without being deterred
by the fear of being <i>thought</i> over-zealous or ostentatious.

<p>At a later period, when it was proposed to erect
a monument in Lichfield Cathedral to the 80th
Queen's, he wrote with reference to their conduct
in this action:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
It is, you know, a Staffordshire regiment, having been
raised originally by the Marquis of Anglesey, and has
still a great number of Staffordshire men in its ranks. It
is a splendid corps, well-behaved in cantonments, and first-rate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
in action. I lay between them and my present regiment
(1st E. B. Fusileers) on the night of the 21st of
December, at Ferozeshah, when Lord Hardinge called
out "80th! that gun must be silenced." They jumped
up, formed into line, and advanced through the black
darkness silently and firmly; gradually we lost the sound
of their tread, and anxiously listened for the slightest intimation
of their progress,&mdash;all was still for five minutes,
while they gradually gained the front of the battery whose
fire had caused us so much loss. Suddenly we heard a
dropping fire,&mdash;a blaze of the Sikh cannon followed,
then a thrilling cheer from the 80th, accompanied by a
rattling and murderous volley as they sprang upon the
battery and spiked the monster gun. In a few more
minutes they moved back quietly, and lay down as before
in the cold sand: but they had left forty-five of their
number and two captains to mark the scene of their
exploit by their graves.</p>

<p>The fortune of war has again interfered between me
and my good intentions of answering all my correspondence
by this mail. We have been knocked about for
some days so incessantly that there has been no chance
of writing anything; and even this scrawl, I fear, will
hardly reach you. You will hear publicly of our great
victory of the 10th,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and of the total and final rout of the
Sikh force. But first, I must tell you that the 2d Grenadiers
were sent back about a week ago to the villages
and posts in our rear, to keep open the communication.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
Not liking the notion of returning to the rear while an
enemy was in front, I applied immediately to do duty
with another regiment; my petition was granted; and I
joined the 16th Grenadiers on the evening of the 9th
inst. About three in the morning we advanced towards
the Sikh intrenchments along the river's bank. Our
guns and ammunition had all come up a day or two before,
and during the night were placed in position to shell
their camp. At daybreak, seventeen heavy mortars and
howitzers, rockets, and heavy guns commenced a magnificent
fire on their position; at half-past eight the infantry
advanced,&mdash;Sir R. Dick's division on the right,
and ours (Gilbert's) in front,&mdash;covered by our fire from
the batteries. On we went as usual in the teeth of a
dreadful fire of guns and musketry, and after a desperate
struggle we got within their <i>triple</i> and <i>quadruple</i> intrenchments;
and then their day of reckoning came indeed.
Driven from trench to trench, and surrounded on all
sides, they retired, fighting most bravely, to the river,
into which they were driven pell-mell, a tremendous fire
of musketry pouring on them from our bank, and the
Horse Artillery finishing their destruction with grape.
The river is literally choked with corpses, and their camp
full of dead and dying. An intercepted letter of theirs
shows that they have lost 20,000 in killed, wounded, and
missing; all their guns remaining in our hands. I had
the pleasure myself of spiking two guns which were
turned on us. Once more I have escaped, I am thankful
to say, unhurt, except that a bullet took a fancy to my
little finger and cut the skin off the top of it,&mdash;a mere pin
scratch, though it spoiled a buckskin glove. I am perfectly
well; we cross in a day or two, but I fancy have
done with fighting.</p>

In honor of your birthday, I suppose, we crossed the

on this side the river! The war is over: sixty days

<p>About this time Mr. Thomason says, in a letter
to my father:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I hear of William constantly from friends in

in his regiment. I had some little fear that
his great superiority in age and attainments to
those of his own standing in the army might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
make him the object of envy and disparagement.
I felt that he had no easy task before him, and
that it would be difficult to conduct himself with
discretion and becoming humility in such a position.
He was quite aware of the difficulty when
we talked the matter over at Agra, and I am
much pleased to see the success which has attended
his prudent exertions."</p>

<p>The army breaks up now very soon, but I shall be
posted before that. I am trying to get into the 1st European
regiment, now stationed at Umb&acirc;la, who have just
been styled Fusileers for their distinguished service. It
is the finest regiment in India, with white faces, too, and
a very nice set of officers. I have been brigaded with
them all along.</p>

<p>It seems an age since the campaign opened. One <i>day</i>
of fighting such as we have had fastens itself on the
memory more than a year of peaceful life. We must
really have a natural taste for fighting highly developed,
for I catch myself wishing and "asking for more," and
grumbling at the speedy settlement of things, and the
prospect of cantonments instead of field service. Is it not
marvellous, as if one had not had a surfeit of killing?
But the truth is, <i>that</i> is not the motive, but a sort of undefined
ambition.... I remember bursting into tears in
sheer rage in the midst of the fight at Sobraon at seeing
our soldiers lying killed and wounded. Don't let any of my
friends forget me yet. I have found a new one, I think,

<p>
I must thank you very much for making me known

<p>The last returning regiment of the army of the Sutlej
crossed that river yesterday morning, and by to-morrow
every man will have left its banks, on their way to their
stations. It was a most interesting and picturesque sight
to see the army filing across the splendid bridge of boats
constructed by our engineers at this place. So many of
the native corps have been required for the new province
and for the Lahore garrison, that we had hardly any but
Europeans homeward-bound, which gave an additional
and home interest to the passage of the river. Dusty,
travel-stained, and tired, but with that cool, firm air of
determination which is the most marked characteristic of
English soldiers, regiment after regiment passed on, cavalry,
artillery, and infantry in succession, their bands
playing quicksteps and national tunes, as each stepped
upon the bridge. To <i>you</i> the sight would have been
only interesting; but to those of us who had seen the
same corps three months ago, their reduced numbers and
fearfully thinned ranks told a sadder tale. Regiments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
cut down to a third, individual companies to a fourth or
fifth of their former strength, gave a silent but eloquent
reply to the boastful strains of martial music, and to the
stirring influence of the pageant. As each regiment
moved up on this side the river, our fine old chief addressed
a few words of congratulation and praise to each;
they pushed on to their tents, and a genuine English
cheer, caught up and repeated from corps to corps, and a
thundering salute from the artillery, proclaimed the final
dispersion, and bid an appropriate farewell to the army
of the Sutlej.</p>

<p>Thus ends my first campaign! To-morrow I march
with the 26th Native Infantry to Umb&acirc;la, where I hope
to be transferred to the 1st Europeans. I was posted to
the 26th a few days ago, but have not joined yet, as I
applied at once for an exchange. Marching and living
in tents is becoming unpleasantly hot now, and in another
fortnight will be very bad. Yesterday we had a regular
storm of wind and dust, filling everything with sand, and
darkening the air most effectually; one's mouth, eyes,
ears, and pockets get filled with dust; you sit down to
breakfast, and your plate is ready loaded with sand, your
coffee is excellently thickened, and your milk would pass
for clotted cream,&mdash;but for the color. Then you get a
sheet of paper, and vainly imagine you're writing, but
the sand conceals the last word you write ere the ink can
dry, and your pens split of themselves with the dryness
of the air. In truth, it is next to impossible to do anything
while the storm lasts, for one's eyes smart and cry
with the plenitude of grit; and if you talk, you are set
coughing with eating small stones! Yet all this is far
better than the damp-exhaling heat of Bengal. Here the
ground and air are as dry by night as by day, and no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
exhalation poisons the freshness of any wind that may be

<p>It is time indeed to be getting under cover, for we
have been in the thick of the "hot winds." This sounds
a very mild word, but you should only just try it! Do
you remember ever holding your face over a stove
when it was full of fire? and the rush of hot air which
choked you? Well, something of that sort, of vast
volume and momentum, blowing what they call at sea
"half a gale of wind," comes quietly up, at first behind
a wall of dust, and then with a roar bursts upon you,
scorching you, and shrivelling you up as if you were "a
rose that was plucked." It feels as if an invisible, colorless
flame was playing over your face and limbs, scorching
without burning you, and making your skin and hair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
crackle and stiffen until you are covered with "crackling"
like a hot roast pig. This goes on day after day
from about eight or nine o'clock in the morning till sunset;
and, accompanied with the full power of the blazing
sun of India, produces an amount of heat and dryness
almost inconceivable. The only resource is to get behind
a tatta (or wet grass mat) hung up at one of the
doors of the tent, and to lie on the ground with as little
motion as possible, and endeavor to sleep or read it out.
<i>Nunc veterum libris, nunc somno et inertibus horis</i>,&mdash;I
cannot go on, for the "sweet forgetfulness" of the past is
too much to expect! To-day we have a new nuisance in
the shape of a plague of wood-lice; our camp is pitched in
an old grove of mango-trees, and is literally swarming
with huge pale lice, in numbers numberless. You cannot
make a step without slaying them, and they have already
(noon) covered the whole sides of the tents, chairs, beds,
tables, and everything. But one is really getting used to
everything, and I hardly expect to be <i>proud</i> again. Our
rest has been terribly destroyed by this last month's
marching, the usual hour for the <i>reveille</i> being two <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>,
and this morning a quarter to one!! and no power of
quizzing can move our worthy major to let us take it
easily, though I don't scruple to tell him that he has sold
his shadow or his soul to the evil powers, and forfeited
the power of sleep, he is such a restless animal! We
breakfast at seven, or even a quarter past six, constantly,
and dine at seven <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>; so one has a fair opportunity of
practising abstinence, as I rigidly abstain from eating in
the mean time, or drinking. After all, it is very healthy
weather, and I imagine there is less harm done to the
health in the hot winds than even in the cold weather. I
have never been so well in India.

<p>I am writing from the last new Hill Station, discovered
about three years ago by an adventurous traveller,
and now containing forty houses and a bazaar. It is a
"tal," or lake, of about a mile in length, lying in a basin
of the mountains, about 6,200 feet above the sea; the
hills rising about 1,800 feet on all sides of it, and beautifully
wooded from their very summits down to the water's
brink. How I got here remains to be told. You will
remember that I had applied, some time ago, to be transferred
to the 1st Bengal European Fusileers. Well, after
keeping me in suspense some seven weeks, and sending
me the whole way from Lahore to Bareilly in April and
May, I received notice that my application was granted,
and a civil request to go back again. I had had
enough of marching in the plains, and travelling d&acirc;k
would have been madness for me, so I determined on
going up into the hills, and making my way across the
mountain ranges to Subathoo, where my regiment is
stationed. A good-natured civilian at Bareilly offered
to take me with him to this place, from whence I could
make a good start. We started on the morning of the
11th, and drove to Rampoor, stayed there till midnight,
and then set off for the hills. By daylight we got to the
edge of the "Terai," the far-famed hotbed of fever and
tigers, swamps and timber, along the whole ridge of the
Himalayas, stretching along the plains at their feet in a
belt of about twenty miles from the Indus to the Burhampooter.
Here we found horses awaiting us, and,
mounting at once, started for a ride of twenty-seven
miles before breakfast. The first part of the "Terai" is
merely a genuine Irish bog, and the oily, watery ditches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
and starved-looking cows shout out "Fever," on all sides
of you. The last ten miles, to the foot of the hills, is
through a dense mass of ragged trees in all stages of
growth and decay, "horrida, inculta, hirsuta,"&mdash;moist,
unpleasant, and ugly. At length we reached the first
low woody ranges of the hills, and following the dry bed
of a mountain stream, by noon we doubled the last ridge,
and descended upon our lake. None of these hills are
to be compared in beauty with Scotland and Wales,
though very fine, and inexpressibly refreshing, almost
<i>affecting</i>, after the dead flat we have lived in so long.
As soon as my servants arrive, I start hence by myself,
through an unfrequented sea of vast mountains, by way
of Landour, for Mussoorie, to Simla and Subathoo. It
is about 340 miles, and will take me thirty-two or thirty-four
days to accomplish. I mean to take no pony, but
trust that my old powers of walking and endurance will
revive in the mountain air.</p>

<p>When I wrote to you last from Sireenuggur, I hoped
to have been able to reach this place by way of the hills

setting in of the rains made it so difficult and unpleasant
(and likely to be dangerous) to get on, that, after spending
two days there, I rode down to Deyra Dhoon, and
came d&acirc;k through Saharunpoor and Umb&acirc;la to Kalka,
at the foot of these hills, where I found my beast awaiting
my arrival, and mounted the seventeen miles of hill
at once. Here I am, at last, with my own regiment, and
with the prospect of being quiet for four months. I am
eighth Second Lieutenant; a distinguished position (is it
not?) at the age of five-and-twenty. The campaign, I
am sorry to say, did me no good in the way of promotion,

mere shadow of what it was six months ago. We could
only muster 256 men under arms when we were inspected

was a most picturesque body of convalescents present
with their empty sleeves, pale faces, and crutches, but
looking proudly conscious of their good conduct, and
ready "to do it again." We are under much stricter
discipline in this corps, both officers and men, and obliged
to be orderly and submissive. No bad thing for us either.
I hold there is more real liberty in being under a decent
restraint than in absolute freedom from any check. I
have been much more reconciled to India since I joined
this regiment. It is pleasant to have white faces about
one, and hear one's own tongue spoken; and then, besides,
there is a home-loving feeling in this corps which I have
never met with in India. I believe we would each and

He has kindly offered to take me with him for a tour

and enjoying the beauties of Simla.</p>

<p class="left65">
<span class="smcap">Simla</span>, <i>Sept. 14th, 1846</i>.</p>

<p>My original week at Simla has grown into a month,
thanks to Colonel Lawrence's pressing, and Colonel Orchard's
(<i>my</i> colonel's) kindness. I should hardly like
staying so long with Colonel Lawrence, (especially as I
live day and night in the same room with him and his
papers, regularly camp fashion,) but that he wishes it,
and I manage to give him a slight helping hand by making
<i>pr&eacute;cis</i> of his letters, and copying confidential papers.
He is amazingly kind, and tells me all that is going on,
initiating me into the mysteries of "political" business,
and thus giving me more knowledge of things and persons
Indian than I should learn in a year of ordinary life, aye!
or in three years either. This is a great advantage to
my ultimate prospects, of course independently of the
power he possesses of giving me a lift in the world when
I am of sufficient standing to hold any appointment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span></p>

<p>He makes me work at Hindostanee, and has given me
a lesson or two in the use of the theodolite, and other
surveying instruments, to the end that I may get employed
in the Surveying Department, after two years of
which he says "I shall be fit for a Political."</p>

<p>I have been very fortunate in many ways, more so than
I had any right to expect. If I were only nearer to you
all, and had any old friends about me, I should have
nothing to regret or wish for. It is <i>there</i> that the shoe
especially pinches. All minor annoyances are easily got
rid of, but one <i>does</i> find a wonderful lack of one's old
friends and old associations. Society is very different
here from ours at home, and different as it is I have seen
very little of it. Nor am I, with my previous habits, age,
and education, the person to feel this an indifferent matter;
but on the contrary, all the drawbacks of Indian
existence come with redoubled force from the greatness
of the contrast. Still I do not let these things annoy me,
or weigh down my spirits, but strive, by keeping up English
habits, tastes, and feelings, and looking forward to a
run home, (thus having a motive always in view,) to
make the best of everything as it occurs, and to act upon
the principle, that mere outward circumstances don't
make a man's happiness. If I have one feeling stronger
than another, it is contempt for a "regular Indian," a man
who thinks it fine to adopt a totally different set of habits
and morals and fashions, until, in forgetting that he is an
Englishman, he usually forgets also that he is a Christian
and a gentleman. Such characters are happily rare now,
but there are many fragments of it on a small scale, and
always must be so, so long as the men who are to support
the name and power of England in Asia are sent out
here at an age when neither by education nor reflection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
can they have learnt all or even a fraction of what those
words imply. It would be a happy thing for India and
for themselves if <i>all</i> came out here at a more advanced
age than now, but <i>one</i> alone breaking through the custom
in that respect made and provided, must not expect to
escape the usual fate, or at least the usual annoyances,
of innovators.</p>

<p>I have enjoyed my visit here very much, and though I
have not sought them, have made one or two very pleasant
acquaintances, or improved them. I have been very
little out, and passed my time almost entirely with Colonel
Lawrence and his family, <i>i.e.</i>, his brother and the
two sisters-in-law. Things are not looking well on the
frontier. Cashmere and the hill country wont submit to
Gholab Singh, to whom we gave them over, and have
been thrashing his troops and killing his ministers; and I
expect October will see an army assembled to frighten
them into submission, or interfere with a strong arm, as
the case may be.</p>

<p>We seem bound to see him established on the throne
we carved out for him, and it is our only chance of keeping
peace and order; though at the best he is such a
villain, and so detested, that I imagine it will be but a
sorry state of quietness:&mdash;</p>

<p>In a letter to his wife, written during this visit,
Sir H. Lawrence says:&mdash;</p>
<p>
<i>Sept. 1st.</i>&mdash;"I brought up with me from Subathoo
a fine young fellow, by name Hodson, son
of the Archdeacon of Stafford. He is now (10
<span class="smcap">p. m.</span>) sleeping in my little office-room, where I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
am writing. Thomason recommended him to
me, and I have seldom met so promising a young
fellow. He left the native branch of the army
at the expense of some steps, because he did not
like the conduct of the Sepoys. He was for four
years with Dr. Arnold, and two in the sixth form
under his eye. He speaks most affectionately of
him. I will try to get leave for him for a month
to accompany me to Lahore and Jummoo in October....
I get a good deal of help from Hodson,
who works <i>willingly</i> and <i>sensibly</i>. Perhaps
you may meet the family at Lichfield."</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left55">
<span class="smcap">Lahore</span>, <i>October 14th, 1846</i>.</p>

<p>As I hoped when I wrote last, I am again writing
from the capital of the "Singhs," but, alas for the "lions,"
their tails are very much down in the world since this
time last year, when the "fierce and formidable army"
assembled to invade our tempting provinces. Nearly
half the garrison has marched across the Ravee, and
not more than 5,000 or 6,000 British troops now hold the
far-famed capital of Runjeet Singh.</p>

<p>You must not be alarmed by the accounts you will see
in the papers by this mail of the advance of two forces
from Lahore and Jullunder towards Jummoo. They are
not to take any active part in the operations of Gholab
Singh for the recovery of Cashmere from the rebellious
Sheikh Imaumoodeen; our troops are to hold the Maharaja's
country for him while he advances with his
whole disposable force, augmented by a Sikh auxiliary
army.</p>

<p>It is probable that the Sheikh will give in without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
fighting as soon as he hears the preparations made by
both powers for his coercion. Indeed, a letter has arrived
from Cashmere to say he <i>has</i> given in; but he is a wily
fellow, and I mightily distrust him. I only know if <i>I</i>
was in Cashmere with my army at my back, <i>I</i> would not
give in as long as a man was left to pull a trigger! The
Agent (Colonel Lawrence) and I start to-morrow evening,
going seventy miles the first day, and hope to reach
Bhimbur, at the foot of the hills, on the 17th, thence to
go up and join the Maharaja, and accompany his army to
Cashmere. If he fights we shall see the fun; if not, we
are to accompany him and keep him from excesses and
injustice in the valley, and return here, I fancy, in about
a month or six weeks. Of course, in event of the two
armies coming to blows, it will probably be some time
longer ere we return. I am delighted at the thoughts of
seeing Cashmere, and am gaining great advantage from
being with these "politicals" in the way of learning the
languages, and method of governing the natives. I have
been hard at work day and night for some time now,
writing for Colonel Lawrence. I left Subathoo on the
1st, and after a ride of some twenty miles through the
hills, joined Colonel Lawrence and Mr. Christian, and
after a shake-down in a little mud bungalow, and an
amusing dinner, (served up in two brass basins, standing
on a bed,) and a breakfast to match, we rode down to
Roopur, on the Sutlej. Here we took boat, and floated
down the river to Ferozepoor, and came across to Lahore
during the night in a capital barouche belonging
to the Ranee, with relays of horses and an escort of
cavalry.

<span class="smcap">Thanna, at the foot of the pass into Cashmere</span>,<br />
<i>Oct. 26th, 1846</i>.</p>

<p>Our tent is pitched on the top of a little spur from the
mountain side, and beneath us lie, in quaint picturesque
confusion, scattered over the valley and the little staircase-like
rice-fields, the mingled hosts of Lahore and Jummoo.
The spare stalwart Sikh, with his grizzled beard and blue
turban of the scantest dimensions, side by side with the
huge-limbed Affghan, with voluminous headgear and
many-colored garments. The proud Brahmin in the
same ranks with the fierce "Children of the Faithful;"
the little active Hillman; the diminutive, sturdy, platter-faced
Ghoorka, and the slight-made Hindostanee, collected
in the same tents, and all alike clothed in a caricature
of the British uniform. I have been very much
interested and amused by this march with a native army,
so different from our own proceedings and our own military
power,&mdash;albeit the British army will soon be as
varied in its composition.</p>

<p>I have seen a great deal of the native Sirdars or chiefs,
especially Tej Singh who commanded the Sikh forces
in the war, and of the Maharaja. The former a small,
spare little man, marked with the smallpox, and with a
thin and scanty beard, but sharp and intelligent, and by
his own account <i>a hero</i>. The Maharaja is a fine, tall,
portly man, with a splendid expressive face, and most
gentlemanly, pleasing manner, and fine-toned voice,&mdash;altogether
the most pleasing Asiatic I have seen,&mdash;to all
appearance the gentlest of the gentle, and the most sincere
and truthful character in the world; and in his
habits he is certainly exemplary; but he is the cleverest
hypocrite in the world; as sharp and acute as possible,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
devoured by avarice and ambition, and when roused, horribly
cruel. This latter accusation he rebuts, by alleging
the necessity of the case and the ferocity of those he has
to deal with. To us, however, his fondness for flaying
men alive, cutting off their noses and ears and hands, &amp;c.,
savors <i>rather</i> of the inexcusable. He was accused of
having flayed 12,000 men, which he indignantly asserted
was a monstrous calumny, as he only skinned <i>three</i>;
afterwards he confessed to <i>three hundred</i>! Yet he is not
a bit worse, and in many ways infinitely better, than most
native princes. Lawrence doubts whether <i>one</i> could be
found with fewer faults, if placed in similar circumstances.
Avitabile, to the disgrace of his European blood, was far
more cruel. The stories current in the Punjaub of his
abominations are horrible. The costumes of these chiefs
would delight you: they never make a mistake in colors,
and the effect is always good, however bright they
may be. This force is (as I told you) moving up to turn
the Sheikh Imaumoodeen, the rebellious vassal of the
Lahore Government, out of Cashmere, in virtue of the
treaty ceding it to Gholab Singh. Up to yesterday, I
expected it would be a fight, but yesterday the Sheikh
sent letters to say he was sorry and repentful, and was on
his way to tender his submission. So we wait here to
receive him. This will not, however, prevent my visit to
the valley, as Colonel Lawrence intends to accompany
the Maharaja to pacify and take possession.</p>

<p>It is very cold here, though not much above 5,000 feet
above the sea.

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left45"><span class="smcap">Shupyen, in Cashmere</span>, <i>Nov. 6th, 1846</i>.</p>

<p>I write a hurried line to announce my safe arrival in
the valley. On the 1st instant we got hold of the rebellious
Sheikh, and sent him down to the plains; and yesterday,
Colonel Lawrence, Captain Browne, and myself,
rode into the valley, amid the acclamations of an admiring
population&mdash;of beggars! I am writing at sunrise in
a little tent, and in spite of two coats and waistcoats, I am
nearly "friz." We crossed the Pir Punjal Pass on the
4th, 12,000 feet above the sea, with snow all around us,
and slept on this side in an old serai; I say <i>slept</i>, because
we went to bed; but sleeping was out of the question,
from the cold and uproar of all our followers and their
horses, crowded into a court-yard thirty feet square, horses
and men quarrelling and yelling all night long. The
view from the top of the Pass was very fine, but the
wind far too high to take more than a peep of it without
losing one's eyes; but the road from Thanna to the summit
was most lovely the whole way, winding up a glen
wooded magnificently, and the rocks towering above us on
all sides; the trees were all in their varied autumn dress,
surmounted by forests of pine; altogether, I never saw
so grand a scene. As the Sheikh's submission has cut
the Gordian knot of politics here, we shall only stay a
few days to see the valley, and install the Maharaja, (who
is following us with his force by slow stages,) and then
rush back to Lahore and Subathoo.</p>

<p>This is said to be the largest town but three in the valley.
It is a poverty-stricken, scattered hamlet of mud
houses with wooden roofs, the upper half being generally
rough open lattice-work or railing, with alternate supports
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
of unbaked bricks; low mud inclosures, and open waste
spaces between, dedicated to dogs and dunghills. The
whole is thickly grown over with fine apple and walnut
trees, the staple fruits (with the grape) of the valley, and
the food of the people. <i>They</i> are a poor wretched set,
only good for beasts of burden,&mdash;and certainly they can
carry a vast load,&mdash;their dress, both men and women,
being a loose, wide-sleeved smock-frock of dirty sackcloth-looking
woollen. The men wear a dirty skullcap on
their shaven "nobs," and the women a crimson machine,
like a flower-pot saucer inverted, from which depends a
veil or cloth of the same texture as the frock; legs and
feet clothed in their native dirt. The women are atrociously
ugly, and screech like the witches in <i>Macbeth</i>,&mdash;so
much so, that when the Agent asked me to give them
a rupee or two, I felt it my duty to refuse, firmly but
respectfully, on the ground that it would be encouraging
ugliness! I fancy the climate and the soil are unrivalled,
but years of poverty and oppression have reduced to a
nation of beggars what ought to be a Paradise. We go
hence after breakfast to Islumabad, at the eastern end of
the valley; and spend a day or two in looking about us,
and floating down the river to Cashmere itself, by which
time our "prince" will have arrived. I am the luckiest
dog unhung to have actually got into Cashmere. I fancy
I am the first officer of our army who has been here, save
the few who have come officially. These delightful breezes
are most invigorating. I only wish you could all enjoy
these travels with me. I expect to be back at Subathoo
by the 1st of December.</p>
</div>

<p>In a letter to my father about this time, Mr.
Thomason says:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span></p>

<p>"I am very glad to observe that such an intimacy
has sprung up between Colonel Lawrence
and your William. He could not be under better
direction.</p>

<p>"Colonel Lawrence has evidently taken him
entirely into his confidence, which cannot but be
of the greatest use to him in his future career.
He will have opportunities of observation and
instruction now, which very few possess after a
long period of service. To be selected, too, as
his confidant by a man of Colonel Lawrence's
stamp, is no small feather in the cap of any
young man. He stands deservedly high also in
the esteem of all who know him; and if it
please God to spare his life and give him health,
his prospects are as good as any man's can be in
this country."</p>

<p>Colonel Lawrence having discovered that my
brother could <i>work</i>, was by no means disposed to
let him remain without full occupation, as his
next letter will show:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left65"><span class="smcap">Subathoo</span>, <i>April 1st, 1847</i>.</p>

<p>I am wonderfully well and flourishing, and have lots to
do. Lawrence has made me undertake the secretaryship
of the new Asylum for European Children, building some
ten miles hence, which will give me volumes of correspondence,
and leagues, nay latitudes of riding. Nevertheless,
it is well, and it is a good work. The responsibility
will be great, as a committee of management, on an
average three hundred miles apart, are rather nominal in
their supervision of things.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span></p>

<p class="left65">
<span class="smcap">Subathoo</span>, <i>April 1st, 1847</i>.</p>

<p>If my locomotive instinct has been brought into play
in India, as you suggest, my constructive organs are likely
to have their share of exercise. I have the entire direction
and arrangement of the new Hill Asylum on my
hands just now. It is seven miles hence, of mountain
roads, and what with going and coming, planning, instructing,
and supervising, my time is pretty well occupied,
to say nothing of my regiment, and private affairs.
Building a house in India is a different affair from one's
previous experiences. You begin from the forest and
the quarry, have to get lime burnt, trees cut down, bricks
made, planks sawn up, the ground got ready, and then
watch the work foot by foot,&mdash;showing this "nigger"
how to lay his bricks, another the proper proportions of a
beam, another the construction of a door, and to the several
artisans the mysteries of a screw, a nail, and a hinge.
You cannot say to a man, "Make me a wall or a door,"
but you must with your own hands measure out his work,
teach him to saw away here, to plane there, or drive such
a nail, or insinuate such another suspicion of glue. And
when it comes to be considered that this is altogether new
work to me, and has to be excuded by cogitation on the
spot, so as to give an answer to every inquirer, you may
understand the amount of personal exertion and attention
required for the work.</p>

<p>I have the sole direction and control of nearly four
hundred and fifty workmen, including paying them, keeping
accounts, drawing plans, and everything. I have to
get earth dug for bricks, see the moulds made and watch
the progress of them till the kiln is full, get wood for the
kiln, and direct the lighting of the same, and finally provide
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
a goat to sacrifice to the demon who is supposed to
turn the bricks red! Then I must get bamboos and
grass cut for thatching, and string <i>made</i> for the purpose;
send about the hills for sand for mortar, and limestone to
burn, see it mixed and prepared, and then show the niggers
how to use it. Then the whole of the wood-work must
be set out and made under one's own eye, and a lump of
iron brought from the mine to be wrought (also under
one's direction) into nails and screws, before a single door
can be set up; and when to all this is added the difficulty
of getting hands (I mean in the hills), and the bother of
watching the idlest and most cunning race on earth, you
may suppose my "unpaid magistracy" is no sinecure. I
am not exaggerating or indeed telling half the difficulty,
for fear you should think the whole a romance. You will
naturally ask how I learnt all these trades. I can only
say that you can't be more astonished than I am myself,
and can only satisfy you by the theory that "necessity is
the mother of invention." I am seldom able to sit down
from sunrise to sunset, when I get a hasty dinner, and
am then only too glad to sleep off the effects of the day.
How I have escaped fever during the last month I cannot
think, as it has been terribly hot in the sun, even in the
hills, and I have lived in the blaze of it pretty constantly.
Colonel Lawrence seems determined I shall have nothing
to stop me, for his invariable reply to every question
is, "Act on your own judgment;" "Do what you think
right;" "I give you <i>carte blanche</i> to act in my name, and
draw on my funds," and so forth.</p>

<p>Are you aware of the nature of the institution? It
was started, in idea, by Colonel Lawrence some two or
three years ago, and a sufficient sum of money for a
commencement having been raised, he charged me with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
the erection of the necessary buildings, and the organization
and setting in motion of the great machine which is
to regenerate and save from moral and physical degradation,
sickness, and death, the children of the British
soldiers serving in India. The object is to teach them
all things useful, while you give them the advantage of
a healthy climate, removed from the evil influence of a
barrack-room. The children are to remain in the Asylum
until their parents return to England, or till old
enough to join the ranks, or be otherwise provided for.</p>

<p>Another drag upon my hands is the care of a small
European boy, who was lately found up in Cabul, and is
supposed to be the son of some soldier of the destroyed
army. He has been brought up as a Mussulman, and
made to believe his father was such, and is a very bigot.
Colonel Lawrence sent him to me from Lahore, but forgot
to write about him, so I know no more of him than I have
seen in the newspapers, and have no idea what to do with
him, or where he is to go. He is rather a nuisance, and
I shall be glad when he goes, as there is little but his odd
fate to interest one in him; and I have considerable
doubts as to his genuine origin. He is more like a half-caste
than an "European." Our communication is brief,
as he speaks but little Hindostanee, and I less Persian.
The Asylum is a much more interesting occupation, as,
independently of its object, there is a pleasure in covering
a fine mountain with buildings of one's own designing.</p>
</div>

<p>A few days later he writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
My last few days at the Asylum were enlivened by the
arrival of Mrs. George Lawrence, whose tent was pitched
close to mine, on the hill-top. She is a great acquisition
in a forest life, and a very nice person,&mdash;the wife of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
Captain Lawrence who was one of the Cabul prisoners.
She is to be superintendress until the arrival of the
future man from England. I have fourteen little girls to
take care of, by the same token, and listen to the grumblings
of their nurses. In short, I don't know myself,
and that is the long and short of it. I am going to Simla
for a day or two, to see Mr. Thomason.</p>
</div>
<p>And again, to his brother:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The state of things is so provokingly quiet and placid,
that there seems but small chance of our being called upon
for another rush across country (called a "forced march"),
like the one of December, 1845; and one is obliged
to take to anything that offers, to avoid the "t&aelig;dium
vit&aelig;" which the want of employment engenders in this
"lovely country," in those, at least, who have not learnt
to exist in the philosophical medium of brandy and
cheroots. Did I tell you, by-the-bye, that I abjured
tobacco when I left England, and that I have never
been tempted, by even a night "al fresco," to resume the
delusive habit? Nor have I told you (because I despaired
of your believing it) that I have declined from
the paths of virtue in respect to beer also, these two years
past, seldom or never even tasting that once idolized
stimulant!! It has not been caused alone by a love of
eccentricity, but by the very sensitive state of my inner
man, (achieved in India,) which obliges me to live by
rule. This is all very edifying, no doubt, to <i>you</i>; to me
it is especially so, for I believe if I get on well in India,
it will be owing, physically speaking, to my <i>digestion</i>.

<p class="left65">
<span class="smcap">Subathoo</span>, <i>June 18th, 1847</i>.</p>

<p>I am getting on famously at the Asylum just now, and
have succeeded in getting the children under cover before
the rains. I have narrowly escaped a bad fever through
overwork in the sun, but, by taking it in time, I got right
again. The weather has since taken a turn, and become
much cooler, besides which my principal anxiety is over
for the season. I have certainly had a benefit of work,
both civil and literary, for the Institution, and since
Colonel Lawrence put an advertisement in the papers,
desiring all anxious persons to apply to me, I have had
enough on my hands. It is all very well, but interferes
with my reading no little; and I am sure to get more
kicks than thanks for my pains from an ungrateful and
undiscerning public. However, as long as Colonel Lawrence
leaves everything so completely in my hands, and
trusts so implicitly to my skill and honesty, it would be a
shame not to work "<i>un</i>-like a nigger."</p>

<p>It is intended that the children should remain in the
Institution until they are eighteen years of age, if their
fathers be alive, and until somehow or other provided for,
should they be orphans. The majority of the boys will,
of course, become soldiers; but my belief is, that having
been brought up in the delightful climate of the Himalaya,
they will, after ten or fifteen years, settle down in
the various stations and slightly elevated valleys in these
hills, as traders and cultivators, and form the nucleus of
the first British colony in India. My object is to give
them English habits from the first, which they have in
most cases to learn, from being brought up by native
nurses from infancy. Part of the scheme is to make the
Institution support itself, and I am very shortly going to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
start a farm-yard. I have already got a fine large garden
in full swing; and here you may see French beans, cabbages,
strawberry plants, and fine potatoes (free from
disease). I steadfastly refuse the slightest dash of color
in admitting children. People may call this illiberal, if
they please; the answer is obvious. Half-castes stand
the climate of the plains too well to need a hill sanitorium,
and by mixing them with English children you
corrupt those whom you wish to benefit. The little boy
who was lately redeemed from Cabul, and whom Colonel
Lawrence consigned to my care, is the plague of my
existence. He has the thoroughly lying, deceitful habits,
and all the dirt, of the Affghan races, and not a single
point of interest to counterbalance them.

<p>I have some hopes, though but faint ones, of being
relieved from the necessity of a move to Cawnpore,
[whither his regiment had been ordered,] by obtaining
a berth under Colonel Lawrence. I know that he has
asked for me, and, I believe, for an appointment which
would please me more than any other he could find, as
being one of the most confidential nature, and involving
constant locomotion, and plenty of work both for head,
nerve, and body. But I must not be sanguine, as we
have already a large proportion of officers away from
the regiment, and I am a young soldier, though, alas!
growing grievously old in years.
</p>
</div>

<p>The appointment alluded to was to the
"Corps of Guides," then recently organized by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
Colonel Lawrence for service in the Punjaub.
While this question, however, was still pending,
there seemed a prospect of Lieut. Hodson's succeeding
to the adjutancy of his regiment, and
Colonel Lawrence, as will be seen from the
subjoined letter, recommended his accepting it,
if offered:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left65">
"<span class="smcap">Simla</span>, <i>Sept. 11th</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Hodson</span>,&mdash;I have spoken to the Governor-General
about you, who at once replied, 'Let him
take the adjutancy.' He wishes you well, but is puzzled
by the absentee question. We are all, moreover, agreed
on the usefulness to yourself of being employed for a
time as adjutant to a regiment. There are always slips,
but I know of no man of double or treble your standing
who has so good a prospect before him. Favor and partiality
do occasionally give a man a lift, but depend upon
it that <i>his</i> is the best chance in the long run who helps
himself. So far you have done this manfully, and you
have reason to be proud of being selected at one time
for three different appointments by three different men.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Don't however, be too proud. Learn your duties thoroughly.
Continue to study two or three hours a day;
not to pass in a hurry, but that you may do so two
or three years hence with <i>&eacute;clat</i>. Take advantage of
Becher's being at Kussowlee to learn something of surveying.
All knowledge is useful; but to a soldier, or
official of any sort in India, I know no branch of knowledge
which so well repays the student.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<p>"In Oriental phrase, pray consider that much is said in
this hurried scrawl, and believe that I shall watch your
career with warm interest.</p>

<p class="left45">
"I am, very sincerely yours,</p>

<p class="left65">"<span class="smcap">H. M. Lawrence</span>."
</p>
</div>

<p>The expected vacancy, however, did not occur,
and Colonel Lawrence accordingly renewed his
application for my brother's services in the Punjaub,
and, as will be seen, with success. In the
beginning of October he writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I have every reason to expect that before many days
I shall be gazetted as attached to the Guide Corps. The
immediate result of my appointment will be a speedy
departure to Lahore with Colonel Lawrence, who returns
there to arrange matters before going home.
</p>
</div>

<p>And on the 16th:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
You will, I am sure, rejoice with me at my unprecedented
good fortune in being appointed to a responsible
and honorable post, almost before, by the rules of the
service, I am entitled to take charge of a company of
Sepoys. I shall even be better off than I thought;
instead of merely "doing duty" with the Guide Corps,
I am to be the second in command.
</p>
</div>

<p>The next chapter will show how well Lieut.
Hodson justified Colonel Lawrence's selection of
him for so responsible a command, one which the
course of events made far more important than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
could then have been foreseen. It was in this
that he laid the foundations of his reputation as
an "unequalled partisan leader," and acquired his
experience of the Sikhs, and extraordinary influence
over them.</p>

<p>I almost forget the many events that have happened
since I wrote last. I believe I was "at home" in my
snug little cottage in Subathoo, and now I am in a high
queer-looking native house among the ruins of this old
stronghold of the Path&agrave;ns; with orders "to make a good
road from Lahore to the Sutlej, distance forty miles," in
as brief a space as possible. On the willing-to-be-generally-useful
principle this is all very well, and one gets
used to turning one's hand to everything, but certainly
(but for "circumstances over which I had no control") I
always labored under the impression that I knew nothing
at all about the matter. However, Colonel Lawrence
walked into my room promiscuously one morning, and
said, "Oh, Hodson, we have agreed that you must take
in hand the road to Ferozepoor,&mdash;you can start in a day
or two;" and <i>here I am</i>. Well, I have galloped across
the country hither and thither, and peered into distances
with telescopes, and inquired curiously into abstruse (and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
obtuse) angles, rattled Gunter's chains, and consulted
compasses and theodolites, till I have an idea of a road
that will astonish the natives not a little. Last night I
was up half the night, looking out for fires which I had
ordered to be lighted in sundry places along the line of
the Sutlej at a fixed hour, that I might find the nearest
point. This morning, I had a grand assembly of village
"punches," to discuss with them the propriety of furnishing
able-bodied men for the work. By a little artful
persuasion, I succeeded in raising 700 from a small district,
and am going onwards to hold another such "county
meeting" to-morrow. The mode and fashion that has
always obtained in public works under native governments,
has been to give an order to seize <i>all</i> the inhabitants,
and make them work,&mdash;<i>and not pay them then</i>.
These gentry, therefore, have been so bullied by their
Sikh masters, that they hardly believe my offers of ready-money
payments. My predecessor, an artillery officer,
who came here on the same errand, was turned off for
resorting to violent measures in his anxiety to get hold
of workmen, having hung some of the head men up by
the heels to trees <i>till they were convinced</i>. He got no
good (nor hands either) by his dodge. So I was sent
here on the other persuasion, and you will be glad to
hear, for the credit of the family, that I am gammoning
the dear old punches most deliciously. They'd give me
anything, bless their innocent hearts! when I get under
the village tree with them, or by the village well, and
discourse eloquently on the blessing to society of having
destroyed the Sikhs, and on the lightness of their land-tax.
I hope to be relieved in a month, and go up to
Peshawur to join "the Guides," for this is cruelly hard
work, and I have had enough for one year of native
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
work-people. Besides, I am not strong yet, and have a
horrid cold. I would give anything to be able to sit
down and read a book quietly, a luxury I have not enjoyed
for many a long day. Colonel Lawrence starts for
England on the 30th for two years. I hope you will
contrive to see him, and make his acquaintance. Sir F.
Currie is to be his successor during his absence.

<p>I have been at Lahore to receive Colonel Lawrence's
parting instructions, and say good-bye to him, poor fellow.
He is a genuinely kind-hearted mortal, and has been a
brother to me ever since I knew him. I hope to see him
back in two years, invigorated and renewed, to carry out
the good work which he has so nobly begun.

<p>Your letter met me on my road two days ago, and
emerged from the folds of a Sikh horseman's turban, to
my great delight. I got off my horse, and walked along,
driving him before me till I had read the packet. You
must not conclude, because I am writing to you a second
time from this place, that I have been here ever since I
first commenced operations in these parts. I have been
twice to Lahore, and several times to various intermediate
and more distant places, since then. In short, you
may give up all idea of being able to imagine where I
may be at any given time. My work has progressed
considerably. In three weeks I have collected and got
into working order upwards of a thousand most unwilling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
laborers, surveyed and marked out some twenty miles of
road through a desert and forest, and made a very large
piece of it. I am happy to say I am to be relieved in a
day or two, and sent to survey another district. I have
had one or two visitors the last few days, and therefore
not been so lonely as usual; but my time has been even
more than ever occupied. My duties are nearly as various
as there are hours in the day; at one time digging
a trench, at another time investigating breaches of the
peace. I am a sort of justice of the peace for general
purposes, and have to listen to and inquire into complaints,
and send cases which I think worthy of it for trial to
Lahore. I caught as neat a case of robbing and murder
the other day as ever graced Stafford Assizes; to say
nothing of endless modes of theft, more or less open, according
to the wealth or power of the stealer. This is
the most remarkable scene of ruin I have met with for
many a long day; erst, a nest of the abodes of wealthy
Path&agrave;n nobles, and now a desert tract, of many miles in
extent, covered with ruins, with here and there a dome,
or cupola, or minaret, to mark what has once been.</p>

<p>I am happy to say that I have succeeded in obtaining
a respite on Sundays. Hitherto, all the works I have
had in hand have gone on the same every day, and consequently
one's annoyance and responsibility continued
equally on Sundays. This is happily put an end to, and
I shall have one day's rest a week at least, to say nothing
of higher considerations. An order on the subject was
issued six months ago, but great difficulties were in the
way of its execution.

<p>Here I am off again like a steam-engine, calling at a
series of stations, puffing and panting, hither and thither,
never resting, ever starting; now in a cutting, now in a
tunnel; first in a field, next on a hill: thus passes day
after day, week after week, a great deal of work going
through one's hands, and yet one can give very little account
of one's self at the end of it. At present I am moving
rapidly along the banks of a small canal which traverses
the Do&acirc;b, between the Ravee and Beas rivers, for
purposes of irrigation; accompanying Major Napier,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
to whom the prosecution of all public improvements
throughout the Land of the Five Rivers belongs. We
(the "Woods and Forests" of the day) have nearly
reached the point where the river debouches from the
hills, and have put up for the day in a little garden-house
of Runjeet Singh's, in the midst of a lovely grove of
great extent, through whose dark-green boughs we have
a splendid panorama of the snowy range to back our
horizon. We have great projects of extending the canal
by various branches to feed and fertilize the whole extent
of the Do&acirc;b, which wants nothing but water to make it a
garden, so fertile is the soil. We have come along a
strip of beautiful country, richly cultivated, lying along
the banks of this life-giving little watercourse, and the
weather is perfect, so I am as happy as mere externals
can make one. Certainly we whose lot has fallen on this
side of India, are much to be envied. Here, all day
long, one rides about, clothed as warmly, and even more
so, than in England at this season, enjoying the bright
clear sunshine, and never troubled with thinking of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
sun; whilst at Calcutta they are running into their houses
at nine o'clock to avoid the heat of the day! I imagine
two years in Calcutta would be more <i>wearing</i> than ten up
here; by the same token, I have achieved the respectable
weight of eleven stone ten pounds, being an increase
of seventeen pounds since July. May my shadow never
be less!</p>

<p>I live from the arrival of one mail in expectation of
the next. I had meant to have written a long series of
despatches for this opportunity, and have asked you to do
some commissions for me, but I must postpone it now to
another time, as Major Napier has lots of work for
me. I want a pair of thick blankets; mine were
plundered at Ferozeshah, and I have always mourned
over them since, when cold nights and long marches
come together. In these far countries it is next to impossible
to get anything decent.

<p>For some days I was staying in, and intend returning
again to, a fine picturesque old castle or fort built by the
Emperor Shahjehan. Its lofty walls, with their turrets
and battlements, inclose a quadrangle of the size of the
great court of Trinity, while from the centre rises a dark
mass of buildings three stories high, forming the keep;
presenting externally four blank walls pierced with loopholes,
but within, arches and pillars and galleries, with an
open space in the centre, in which they all face. The
summit rises sixty-four feet, which, in addition to the
great elevation of the mound on which the castle stands,
gives a noble view of mountain, river, and plain, covered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
with the finest timber and green with young corn; the
whole backed by range on range, peak after peak, of dazzling
snow. Another, nearly similar, lies about ten miles
to the north, and I am now "pitched" at the foot of a
third to the west; all monuments of the taste and grandeur
of the Mogul Emperors. That Goth, Runjeet Singh,
and his followers have as much to answer for in their way,
as Cromwell and his crop-eared scoundrels in England
and Ireland. They seem only to have conquered to destroy,&mdash;every
public work, every castle, road, serai, or
avenue, has been destroyed; the finest mosques turned
into powder magazines and stables, the gardens into cantonments,
and the fields into deserts. I had a pretty
specimen the other day of the way in which things have
been managed here. I was desired to examine into, and
report on, the accounts of revenue collected hitherto in
180 villages along the "Shah Nahr," or Royal Canal.
By a convenient mixture of coaxing and threats, compliment
and invective, a return was at last effected, by which
it appeared that in ordinary cases about one half the revenue
reached the treasury, in some one third, and in one
district <i>nothing</i>! To my great amusement, when I came
to this point, the gallant collector (a long-bearded old
Sikh) quietly remarked,&mdash;"Yes, Sahib, this was indeed
a great place for us entirely." I said, "Yes, you villain,
you gentry grew fat on robbing your master." "Don't
call it robbing," he said; "I assure you I wouldn't be
dishonest for the world. I never took more than my predecessors
did before me." About the most <i>na&iuml;ve</i> definition
of honesty I have had the luck to meet with. I
fancy our visit to these nooks and corners of the Punjaub
has added some 50,000<i>l.</i> a year to the revenue. My
present <i>r&ocirc;le</i> is to survey a part of the country lying along
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
the left bank of the Ravee and below the hills, and I am
daily and all day at work with compasses and chain, pen
and pencil, following streams, diving into valleys, burrowing
into hills, to complete my work. I need hardly
remark, that having never attempted anything of the kind
hitherto, it is bothering at first. But one is compelled to
be patient under this sort of insult, and I should not be
surprised any day to be told to build a ship, compose a
code of laws, or hold assizes;&mdash;in fact, 'tis the way in India;
every one has to teach himself his work, and do
it at the same time; if I go on learning new trades as
fast during the remainder of my career as I have done at
its commencement, I shall have to retire as a Jacksonian
professor at least, when "my dog has had his day."
Well! I have fairly beaten the cold this time,&mdash;I turned
back one side of the tent, and had a big fire lighted outside,
protected from draughts by a canvas screen, and the
whole tent is now in a jolly glow; a gypsy light reflected
on the trees around, and on the two tall picturesque Affghans
who, seated cross-legged on each side of the fire,
either replenish it with sticks, fan it into a flame, or watch
my pen with the large, black, inquisitive eye of a dog
looking out for a crust.</p>

<p>They make much better servants for wandering folks
like myself than the Hindostanee servant-tribe, have
fewer or no prejudices, (save against clean water,) and
trudge along the livelong day as merrily as if life was a

<p>I really have very little to tell you of my new Guide
Corps duties from the somewhat strange fact that I have
never yet actually entered upon them; this will soon
come to an end, however, as I have directions to proceed
to Peshawur as soon as the survey I have been at work
on is completed. The grand object of the corps is to train
a body of men in peace to be efficient in war; to be not
only acquainted with localities, roads, rivers, hills, ferries,
and passes, but have a good idea of the produce and
supplies available in any part of the country; to give
<i>accurate</i> information, not running open-mouthed to say
that 10,000 horsemen and a thousand guns are coming,
(in true native style,) but to stop to see whether it may
not be really only a common cart and a few wild horsemen
who are kicking up all the dust; to call twenty-five
by its right name, and not say <i>fifty</i> for short, as most natives
do. This of course wants a great deal of careful
instruction and attention. Beyond this, the officers should
give a tolerably correct sketch and report of any country
through which they may pass, be <i>au fait</i> at routes and
means of feeding troops, and above all (and here you
come close upon practical duties) keep an eye on the
doings "of the neighbors" and the state of the country,
so as to be able to give such information as may lead to
any outbreak being nipped in the bud. This is the <i>theory</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
what the <i>practice</i> may be I'll tell you some day or other
when I know. Hitherto I have been making myself generally
useful under the chief engineer, and learning to
survey. One has to turn one's hand to everything if one
wishes to get on.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I am busily collecting every species of
information about the people and the land they live in.
Hard work and fatigue, of course, but a splendid opening
and opportunity for making one's self known and <i>necessary</i>.

</p>

<p>The night your letter reached me, Napier (our chief
engineer) and I were encamped on a spur of grass land
separating two streams of the river "Chukkir," and had
been so for some days. That evening it began to rain,
(if a sluice of water, apparently <i>struck down from the
heavens</i> by a flood of the fiercest lightning, can be called
so,) and for thirty-six hours the torrent descended without
intermission, as only Asiatic storms can descend. At
length a pause ensued, and the sky was visible, and we
emerged from our sodden tents only to be threatened
with water in a worse form. The hills, valleys, and
mountains began to send down to us what they had so
plentifully received from above, and the hitherto quiet
stream, whose wide stony channel surrounded us, was in
a single hour a powerful torrent, tearing over the country
as if to prove what it could do. By one of the singular
freaks common to all tropical rivers, it dammed up one
of its own widest outlets by the quantity of stones which
it brought along with it, and came tearing down the one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
nearest to us. Across this, not a hundred yards from
our tents, we had just built a powerful breakwater some
sixteen feet wide, but the water quietly walked over,
under, and round it; roared, groaned, stormed, and
swelled angrily for two hours, and our breakwater was a
"thing of history;" meantime, we were gradually getting
more and more surrounded with water, it rose and
rose until only four inches were wanting to set us well
afloat. The pegs of my tent-ropes were undermined,
and a notice to quit was as plainly written on the face of
the water as ever on a legal process. There was but
one way of escape, so mustering the whole of a neighboring
village, we loaded all our valuables and movables
on their backs, and made a dash at the hamlet. Once
having succeeded in turning us out, the valiant Chukkir
was content, and we slept in our tents as usual, but not
without, as it turned out, considerable risk of finding
ourselves landed in some unknown field on waking.</p>

<p>When this flood subsided, it appeared that the scene
of our unfortunate dam had become the deepest part of
the channel, and the old course choked with stones and
boulders which you and I couldn't lift in a week of
Sundays. Is not this an incident?</p>

<p>Since I wrote last, in consequence of representations
I sent to head-quarters as to the amount of plundering
going on, a large party of horse, with one of the principal
chiefs, was sent out here, with directions to act on the
information I gave them. We have, accordingly, had a
robber-hunt on a large and tolerably successful scale.
Numbers have been caught. One shot <i>pour encourager
les autres</i>, and we have traces of others, so that my quiet
practice (originally for my own amusement and information)
has been very useful to the State. I found out the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
greatest part of it by sending clever fellows disguised as
"faqueers" (you know what they are, I think;&mdash;religious
beggars) to the different villages to talk to the
people and learn their doings. Some of the stories of
Sikh violence, cruelty, and treachery which I have picked
up are almost beyond belief. The indifference of these
people to human life is something appalling. I could
hardly get them to give a thought or attempt an inquiry
as to the identity of a man whom I found dead, evidently
by violence, by the roadside yesterday morning; and
they were horrified at the thought of tying up or confining
a sacred ox, who had gored his <i>thirteenth</i> man the
evening before last! They told me plainly that no one
had a right to complain of being hurt by so venerable a
beast.</p>

<p>In such pursuits, combined with surveying, my time
passes away tolerably well. I am alone again, Napier
having gone to Lahore; but this is a sweet place, and
I am staying in a pleasant summer-house of Runjeet
Singh's, in the midst of a fine garden, or grove of mango
and orange trees.

and a half miles with tent and baggage this morning,
and hope to continue at that pace, with the difference of
marching by night, the weather having suddenly become
very hot indeed.</p>

<p>I am much interested in the thought of going to so new
a place as Mooltan&mdash;new, that is to say, to Europeans,
yet so important from position and commerce. The only
drawback is the heat, which is notorious throughout
Western India. I am not aware, however, that it is otherwise
unhealthy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span></p>

<p>As you may suppose, I am much gratified by the appointment,
both for its own sake and also as evincing so
very favorable and kindly a disposition toward myself on
the part of the new potentate.

<p>Of incidents to amuse you I have not many to narrate,
save the usual "moving" ones by "flood and field." On
the 18th I was very nearly becoming a damp unpleasant
corpse to celebrate my birthday. In attempting a ford,
my horse sank up to the girths in a quicksand. I managed
to extricate myself and, dry land being near, he got
up without damage. Sending a man ahead, I tried again
in another place. Here it was fair to the eye but false
to the foot. Down he went again, this time in deeper
water, and got me under him by struggling. However, I
realized the old proverb, and escaped with a good ducking
and a mouthful of my native element, <i>rather</i> gritty.
Next I tried a camel, but the brute went down at the
first stride. So giving it up in despair, I put on dry
clothes, and <i>then</i> waded through the river.</p>

<p>Not content with one attempt on my existence, the
horse gave me a violent kick the same evening when I
went up to him to ask "How d'ye do." So I completed
my year, in spite of myself, as it were.
</p>

<span class="left65 smcap">Lahore</span>, <i>April 2d</i>.</p>

<p>Since the above was written, I have succeeded in
reaching the metropolis, as you see, at a greater expenditure
of animal heat and fatigue than I have gone through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
for some time. I was very friendlily and pleasantly
greeted by Sir F. and Lady Currie, and tumbled at once
again into the tide of civilization&mdash;loaf bread, arm-chairs,
hats, and ladies&mdash;as philosophically as if I had been for
months in the calm and unrestrained enjoyment of such
luxuries.</p>

<p>On my arrival, I found that the arrangement proposed
in Sir F. Currie's note had already become matter of history,
<i>not</i> of fact. The new one is still better for me. I
am to remain at Lahore, and be an assistant to the Resident,
having my Guide duties to discharge also, when
Lumsden arrives from Peshawur with the Corps. He is
expected in twenty days. Nothing could possibly have
been better for me. I shall have the advantage of learning
in the best school, head-quarters, and have many
more opportunities of making myself "generally useful."
I am most rejoiced at the plan, and Sir F. Currie's considerate
kindness in devising it. We wont say anything
of the regularity or consistency of making a man of two
and a half year's service, and who has passed no examination,
a political officer, nor will we be ungrateful enough
to say that he is unfit for the appointment, but that he
should do his utmost to show that the rule is more honored
"in the breach than in the observance."

<p>I shall not have the same variety to chronicle now that
I seem to be fixed here, but more interest and a higher
style of work. Since I wrote last I have been six hours
a day employed in court, hearing petitions and appeals in
all manner of cases, civil and criminal, and in matters of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
revenue, as there are but two officers so employed. You,
perhaps, will comprehend that the duty is no sinecure.
It is of vast importance, and I sometimes feel a half sensation
of modesty coming over me at being set down to
administer justice in such matters so early, and without
previous training. A little practice, patience, and reflection
settle most cases to one's satisfaction, however; and
one must be content with substantial justice as distinguished
from technical law. In any point of difficulty one
has always an older head to refer to, and meantime, one
has the satisfaction of knowing that one is independent
and untrammelled save by a very simple code. Some
things, such as sentencing a man to imprisonment for
seven years for killing a cow, are rather startling to one's
ideas of right and wrong; but then to kill a cow is to
break a law, and to disturb the public peace&mdash;perhaps
cause bloodshed; so the law is vindicated, and one's conscience
saved. I have many other duties, such as finishing
my map, for which I was surveying at Deenanuggur;
occasionally translating an official document; going to
Durbars, &amp;c.; and when the Guides arrive (on the 20th)
I shall have to assist in drilling and instructing them;
to say nothing of seeing that their quarters are prepared,
and everything ready for them. I am not, therefore,
<i>idle</i>, and only wish I had time to read.

<p>On the 26th he writes from Lahore:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I mentioned to you that Sir F. Currie's plan of sending
me to assist Agnew at Mooltan had been altered, and
that Anderson had gone with him in my stead. At the
time I was disposed to be disappointed; but we never
know what is for our good. In this case I should doubtless
have incurred the horrible fate of poor Anderson and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
Agnew. Both these poor fellows have been barbarously
murdered by the Mooltan troops.
</p>
</div>

<p>He then gives a detailed account of their tragical
fate, and the treachery of the villain Moolraj,
and adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The Sikh Durbar profess their inability to coerce their
rebel subject, who is rapidly collecting a large army, and
strengthening himself in the proverbially strong fort of
Mooltan.</p>

<p>One cannot say how it will end. The necessary delay
of five months, till after the rains, will give time for all
the disaffected to gather together, and no one can say how
far the infection may extend. The Sikhs were right in
saying, "We shall have one more fight for it yet."

<p>I expect to be busy in catching a party of rascals who
have been trying to pervert our Sepoys by bribes and
promises. We have a clue to them, and hope to take
them in the act. We are surrounded here with treachery.
No man can say who is implicated, or how far the
treason has spread. The life of no British officer, away
from Lahore, is worth a week's purchase. It is a pleasant
sort of government to prop up, when their head-men
conspire against you and their troops desert you on the
slightest temptation.</p>

<p>
Lumsden, the commandant of the Guides, and I want
something sensible for the protection of our heads from
sun and blows, from <i>coups de soleil</i> equally with <i>coups
d'&eacute;p&eacute;e</i>. There is a kind of leathern helmet in the Prussian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
service which is light, serviceable, and neat. Will
you try what you can do in the man-millinery line, and
send me a brace of good helmets? We don't want ornament;
in fact, the plainer the better, as we should always
wear a turban over them, but strong, and light as a hat.
I have no doubt your taste will be approved. I hope this
wont be a bore to you, but one's head wants protecting in
these stormy days.
</p>
</div>

<p>The helmets on their arrival were pronounced
"maddening." This was the first of a series of
commissions connected with the clothing and
arming of the Guide Corps, which was left mainly,
if not entirely, in my brother's hands, and was
a matter of much interest to him. The color
selected for their uniform was "drab," as most
likely to make them invisible in a land of dust.
Even a member of the Society of Friends could
scarcely have objected to send out drab clothing
for 900 men, but to this succeeded directions to
select the pattern of, and send out, 300 rifle carbines,
which seemed scarcely a clerical business.
The result, however, was satisfactory, and in the
following year my brother wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

Many thanks for the trouble you have taken about the
clothing for the Guides. Sir C. Napier says they are

<p>You will hardly have been prepared to hear that I am
once more on the move, rushing about the country, despite
climate, heat, and rumors (the most alarming).</p>

<p>I wrote last the day after our successful capture of the
conspirators, whom I had the satisfaction of seeing hung
three days later. I then tried a slight fever as a variety
for two days; and on the 14th started to "bag" the
Ranee in her abode beyond the Ravee, she having been
convicted of complicity in the designs of the conspirators.
Lumsden and myself were deputed by the Resident to
call on her, and intimate that her presence was urgently
required. A detachment was ordered out to support us,
in case any resistance should be offered. Fortunately it
was not required, as the Ranee complied at once with our
"polite" request to come along with us. Instead of being
taken to Lahore, as she expected, we carried her off
to Kana Kutch, on the Ferozepoor road, where a party
of Wheeler's Irregulars had been sent to receive her. It
was very hard work&mdash;a long night march to the fort,
and a fourteen hours' ride across to Kana Kutch, whence
I had two hours' gallop into Lahore to report progress,
making sixteen hours in the saddle, in May, when the
nights are hot. On the next Sunday night I was off
again, to try and seize or disperse a party of horse and
foot collected by a would-be holy man, Maharaja Singh,
said to amount to four or five hundred. I made a tremendous
march round by Umritsur, Byrowal-Ghat, on
the Beas, and up that river's bank to Mokeria, in the
Jullundur Do&acirc;b, whence I was prepared to cross during
the night with a party of cavalry, and attack the rascals
unawares. Everything succeeded admirably up to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
last, when I found that he had received notice from a
rogue of a native magistrate that there would be attempts
made to seize him, when he fairly bolted across the Ravee,
and is now infesting the Do&acirc;b between that river and the
Chenab. I have scoured this part of the country (which
my late surveys enabled me to traverse with perfect ease)
got possession of every boat on the Ravee from Lahore
to the Hills, placed horsemen at every ferry, and been
bullying the people who supplied the Saint with provisions
and arms. I have a regiment of Irregular Horse
(Skinner's) with me, and full powers to summon more, if
necessary, from the Jullundur Do&acirc;b. Meantime, a party
from Lahore are sweeping round to intercept the fellow,
who is getting strong by degrees; and I am going to
dash across at midnight with a handful of cavalry, and
see if I cannot beat up the country between this and
Wuzeerabad. I am very well, hard at work, and enjoying
the thing very much. I imagine this will be the sort
of life we shall lead about once a week till the Punjaub is
annexed. Every native official has fraternized with the
rebels he was ordered to catch.

<p>I wrote last from Deenanuggur, on the eve of crossing
the Ravee to look after the Gooroo, Maharaja Singh. I
remained in the Rechnab Do&acirc;b some days, hunting up
evidence and punishing transgressors.</p>

<p>I was very fairly successful in obtaining information of
the extent of the conspiracy, which has been keeping the
whole country in a ferment these two months past. All
that has occurred is clearly traceable to the Ranee (now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
happily deported) and her friends, and has been carried
out with a fearful amount of the blackest treachery and
baseness. There have been stirring events since I wrote
last. Twice within a fortnight has Herbert Edwardes
fought and defeated the Mooltan rebels in pitched battles,
and has succeeded, despite of treacherous foes and doubtful
friends, in driving them into the fort of Mooltan. His
success has been only less splendid than the energy and
courage which he has shown throughout, especially that
high moral courage which defies responsibility, risks, self-interest,
and all else, for the good of the State, and which,
if well directed, seems to command fortune and ensure
success. I have been longing to be with him, though
after my wonderfully narrow escape of being murdered
with poor Agnew at Mooltan, I may well be content to
leave my movements in other hands. I was summoned
into Lahore suddenly (as usual!) to take command of
the Guides and charge of Lumsden's duties for him, as he
had been sent down the river towards Bhawulpoor. I came
in the whole distance (one hundred miles), with bag and
baggage, in sixty hours, which, considering that one can't
travel at all by day, and not more than four miles an hour
by night, required a great amount of exertion and perseverance.
It is strange that the natives always knock up
sooner than we do on a march like this. The cavalry
were nine days on the road, and grumbled then! I know
few things more fatiguing than when exhausted by the
heat of the day, to have to mount at nightfall, and ride
slowly throughout the night, and for the two most disagreeable
hours of a tropical day, viz: those after sunrise.
One night, on which I was making a longer march than
usual, had a fearful effect on a European regiment moving
upon Ferozepoor, the same hot night-wind, which had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
completely prostrated me for the time, fell upon the men
as they halted at a well to drink; they were fairly beaten,
and lay down for a few minutes to <i>pant</i>. When they
arose to continue their march, a captain and nine or ten
men were left dead on the ground! It was the simoom
of Africa in miniature. I have happily escaped fever or
sickness of any kind, and have nothing to complain of
but excessive weakness. Quinine will, I trust, soon set
me up again.

<p>We have had stirring times lately, though I personally
have had little share in them. Mooltan is at last invested,
and we expect daily to hear of its fall. Meanwhile, a
new outbreak has occurred in Huz&agrave;ra, a wild hilly region
on the left bank of the Indus, above Attok, where one
of the powerful Sirdars has raised the standard of
revolt.</p>

<p>I suppose I may say to you at so great a distance, what
I must not breathe here, that it is now morally certain
that we have only escaped, by what men call chance and
accidents, the effects of a general and well-organized conspiracy
against British supremacy in Upper India. Our
"ally" Gholab Singh, the creature of the treaty of 1848,
the hill tribes, the whole Punjaub, the chiefs of Rajpootana,
and the states round Umb&acirc;la and Kurn&agrave;l, and even
the King of Cabul, I believe, have been for months and
months securely plotting, without our having more than
the merest hints of local disturbances, against the supremacy
of the British Government. They were to unite
for one vast effort, and drive us back upon the Jumna.
This was to be again the boundary of British India. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
rising in Mooltan was to be the signal. All was prepared,
when a quarrel between Moolraj and the treacherous
khan, Singh M&aacute;n, who was sent to commence the war,
spoilt their whole scheme. The proud Rajpoot, Gholab
Singh, refused to follow in the wake of a Mooltan merchant,
and the merchant would not yield to the soldier.
We have seen the mere ebullitions of the storm, the bubbles
which float at the surface. I believe that now we
are safe from a general rising, and that the fall of Mooltan
will put a stop to mischief. If, however, our rulers
resort again to half measures, if a mutinous army is retained
in existence, the evil day will return again. Absolute
supremacy has been, I think, long demonstrated to
be our only safety among wild and treacherous races.
<i>Moderation</i>, in the modern sense, is the greatest of all
weakness.

<p>You will have seen that our troops have been hard at
it in Mooltan, and now I have to tell you that it has all
been in vain; Rajah Shere Singh, and the whole of our
worthy Sikh allies, have joined the rebel Moolraj, and
General Whish has been compelled to raise the siege and
retire.</p>

<p>I have just dispatched every available Guide to try
and get quietly into the far-famed fort of Govindghur,
and hope in a few hours to hear of their success. They
have forty friends inside, and only a few score wavering
enemies. I have not a moment which I can call my own,
and have put off this (which is merely an assurance that
I am alive and very well) to the last moment, so as to
give you the latest tidings. I am all agog at the prospect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>

that you all will be very anxious. I shall not, however,
run my head unnecessarily into a scrape, and see no cause
for your frightening yourselves.</p>

has been played out. It was an experiment honestly

<p>A few days later he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
My Guides have covered themselves with glory (and
dust) by the way in which they got into, and got possession
of, the famed fort of Govindghur. A hundred of
my men, under a native officer&mdash;a fine lad of about
twenty, whom I have petted a good deal&mdash;went up
quietly to the gates, on pretence of escorting four State
prisoners, (whom I had put in irons for the occasion,)
were allowed to get in, and then threw up their caps, and
took possession of the gateway, despite the scowls, and
threats, and all but open resistance of the Sikh garrison.
A day afterwards a regiment marched from Lahore, and
went into garrison there, and so Runjeet Singh's treasure-fort
is fairly in our hands.

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I left Lahore&mdash;but stay, I must get there first. Well,
I wrote from Ramnuggur, on the Chenab, last; whence,
after a fruitless <i>s&eacute;jour</i> of six days, in the vain hope of
meeting Mrs. George Lawrence, I returned suddenly to
Lahore by an order which reached me the evening of the
5th. I started at sunset, and pushing my way on various
borrowed steeds across that dreary region during the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
night, accompanied by a single camel-rider, I reached
Lahore, a distance of seventy miles, by nine the following
morning.</p>

<p>On the 8th I was off again at daybreak on a longer
journey still, having to cross the country to Brigadier
Wheeler's camp in the Jullundur Do&acirc;b, to convey orders
to him relative to the reduction of two rebellious forts in
the Do&acirc;b, between the Ravee and Beas. A "grind" of
some twenty-six hours on <i>camel-back</i>, with the necessary
stoppages, took me to the camp, whence (because I had
not had enough) I recrossed the Beas the same night,
after examining and reporting on the state of the ferries
by which the troops were to follow me. This time I was
escorted by a troop of Irregular Horse, and being thereby,
according to <i>my</i> estimation of Sikh prowess, rendered tolerably
independent, I marched the next morning for the
fort of Rungur Nuggul, some fourteen miles from the
right bank of the Beas.</p>

<p>On approaching it, and the village which covered one
side of it, I was welcomed by a discharge of matchlocks,
&amp;c., as a sort of bravado, which served to point out exactly
the range of my friends' pieces. I lost no time
in getting the horsemen into a secure position (which
means, one equally good for fighting or running away),
and advanced under shelter of the trees and sugar-canes
to within easy distance of the fort. Hence I dispatched
a message to the rebels, to say that if they did not come
to reason within an hour, they should have no choice but
that between cold steel or the gallows. The hour elapsed
without result, so mentally consigning the garrison to annihilation,
I set to work to reconnoitre the ground round
the fort. This accomplished&mdash;with no further interruption
than a shower of unpleasant bullets when I ventured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
too near&mdash;I sat down, and drew a little pencil plan of
the ground and fort, dispatched a trooper with it to the
Brigadier, and then retired to a little village about a mile
off for the night. Another day and night passed in this
precarious fashion, without (as is my usual fate), servants,
clothes, or traps, until at length my own men (Guides)
arrived from Lahore with my baggage and horses. I
could now muster a hundred rifles, and eighty horsemen,
so we set to work to <i>invest the place</i>, being the only way
to render the escape of the rebels difficult or impossible.
The fort, though very small, was immensely strong, and
well garrisoned with desperadoes, and we had sharp work
of it during the two nights and day which elapsed before
the Brigadier<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> appeared with his troops. By keeping
my men scattered about in parties, under cover, the superiority
of their weapons enabled them to gall the defenders
of the fort whenever they showed their heads, day or
night; and whenever they made a sally they got driven
back with the loss of one or two of their companions. At
last the Brigadier appeared, pounded the place with his
guns during the day, and let the garrison escape at night.
Then came the bore of destroying the empty fort, a work
which consumed a week of incessant labor, and forty-one
mines loaded with an aggregate of 8,000 pounds of powder.
Having destroyed house, fort, stables, and everything,
and removed the grain and property, we at length
moved on to a second fort, called "Morara," about a mile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
from the left bank of the Ravee, near this place. I cannot
now go into details of the second failure of the Brigadier
in attempting to punish the rebels, for they bolted
before he fired a shot, nor of my attempts to prevent their
escape. I have had loads of work, what with soldiering,
providing supplies for the force, and all the multifarious
duties which come on the shoulders of a "political" out
here. I am quite well, and the weather is lovely, so
work is easy comparatively, and an active life like this is,
as you know, my particular weakness. I hope to cross
the Ravee in a few days with the troops collecting to punish
the rebel (or patriot) Sikh army. We want Sir C.
Napier sadly. What with the incapacity shown at Mooltan,
and the dilatory proceedings at head-quarters, our
reputation is suffering cruelly, and every one knows that
that is a stain only to be dyed out in blood. Every
week's delay adds thousands to our present foes and
future victims.

<p>You must not suppose that because I have written
twice from this place that therefore I have been here all
the time. On the contrary, I have been incessantly on
the move. So much so as to have pretty nearly established
a claim to the medal for discovering perpetual motion.
I have been moving in an orbit whose gyrations
have been confined to a space bounded by the Chenab
and the Beas, and a line drawn E. and W. through Umritsur
and Lahore. Nearly the whole of this vast "<i>track</i>"
of country has been under my sole charge. I have had
also to feed an army daily of 3,000 odd fighting men,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
2,000 odd horses, and 14,000 to 15,000 camp followers.
Also to take care of and work my Guides; to point out
the haunts and obtain information of the strength of "the
enemy," and give him over to the tender mercies of fire
and sword; <i>item</i>, to fight him personally; <i>item</i>, to destroy
six forts, and sell by auction the property therein found;
<i>item</i>, to be civil to all comers; <i>item</i>, to report all the said
doings daily to Government; <i>item</i>, to march ten to
twenty miles a day at a slow pace; <i>item</i>, to eat, drink,
dress, and sleep, to rest one's self from all these labors. In
the above compendious epitome of the work of that much-abused
and ill-used class called "politicals" in India, you
will, I trust, observe no vacant places or "hiati" in which
you would expect to see inscribed, "<i>item</i>, to write to one's
friends." No; one is a white slave, and no mistake; day
and night, early or late, week-day or Sunday, one is the
slave of the public, or rather of the Government, to a
degree which cannot be credited until it is experienced.
The departure of Brigadier Wheeler across the Beas,
and therefore out of my beat, has made a slight break in
the work, but there is still more than I can get through
in the day. I am grinding my teeth all the time at being
kept away from the scene of what must be the grand
struggle between the cow-killers and cow-worshippers on
the banks of the Chenab.</p>

<p>On the 8th of last month I marched hence to overtake
Brigadier Wheeler and his troops, and accompany them
across the Ravee. On reaching the river, I represented to
the Brigadier "who of course does not know friend from
foe until he is told," the urgent necessity of attacking
a party of insurgents who were within fourteen miles of
us, but could not persuade him to do so. The old gentleman
was intent on pushing on to the main army, flattering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
himself he was going to command a division of it.
When within twenty-five or thirty miles of the head-quarter
camp at Ramnuggur, I rode over to Lahore, and
talked to Sir F. Currie, who was just dispatching an express
to me about these very people we had left unattacked
two days before. He sent me off there and then
to see the Commander-in-Chief, who was very polite;
asked my opinion "and acted on it too!"; told me all his
plans for carrying on the war; and on my telling him the
facts of the case, sent an order to the Brigadier to retrace
his steps, and attack the party he had passed by at
once, with something very like a rap over the knuckles.
After a delay of some days, caused by a sudden counter
summons to move to reinforce Campbell,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> who was
vainly expecting that the Singhs would fight, we at
length turned back for Kul&aacute;llw&aacute;la, the name of the fort
occupied by my friends. We got within twenty-five
miles of it on the 20th, and I urged the Brigadier to
move on like lightning, and crush them. He would not,
and began to make short marches, so I was compelled to
out-man&oelig;uvre him by a bold stroke. On the morning
of the 21st I left his camp, and pushed on some ten
miles to a place on the straight road for Kul&aacute;llw&aacute;la.
Here was a fort belonging to a doubtful Sirdar, and I
determined to get possession of it if possible. I had with
me only 100 men, and the enemy was only eight miles
off with 4,000&mdash;rabble, to be sure, and fellows who have
no heart for fighting; but the odds were great, and it
was necessary to put a bold face on matters. I therefore
"boned" the Chief's two confidential servants, who were
in his dwelling-house outside the fort, and taking one on
each side of me, walked up to the gateway, and demanded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
admission; they hesitated, and made excuses. I
significantly hinted that my two companions should be
responsible if a shot was fired; the stout Sikh heart
failed, and I was admitted. My proceeding was justified,
and rendered most opportune by the discovery that
the garrison were preparing munitions of war, mounting
guns, and looking saucy. I turned them out by the
same means as I had gained admittance, viz: by hinting
that if any resistance was made the headmen by my side
were doomed. Putting in sixteen of my Guides to hold
it until further orders, I took up my quarters outside for
the night, and prepared to attack another small mud fort
near at hand in the morning.</p>

<p>However, my friends ran away in the night in a fright,
and thus I had opened the road to Kul&aacute;llw&aacute;la without
firing a shot. In the morning I marched with my little
party towards the enemy, sending back a messenger to
the Brigadier to say that I was close to the place, and
that if he did not come on sharp they would run away or
overwhelm me. He was dreadfully angry, but came on
like a good boy! When within a mile or so of the fort,
I halted my party to allow his column to get up nearer,
and as soon as I could see it, moved on quietly. The
<i>ruse</i> told to perfection: thinking they had only 100 men
and myself to deal with, the Sikhs advanced in strength,
thirty to one, to meet me, with colors flying and drums
beating. Just then a breeze sprung up, the dust blew
aside, and the long line of horsemen coming on rapidly
behind my party burst upon their senses. They turned
instantly, and made for the fort, so leaving my men to
advance quietly after them, I galloped up to the Brigadier,
pointed out the flying Sikhs, explained their position,
and begged him to charge them. He melted from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
his wrath, and told two regiments of Irregulars to follow
my guidance. On we went at the gallop, cut in amongst
the fugitives, and punished them fearfully. The unfortunate
wretches had cause to rue the day they turned rebels,
for we left them thickly on the ground as we swept
along. I had never charged with cavalry before, or come
so directly into hand to hand conflict with the Sikh, save
of course in the trenches at Sobraon. About 300 to 400
escaped into the fort, while the remainder threw down
their arms and dispersed over the country. The garrison
ran away during the night, unfortunately, and we had
only to take peaceful possession in the morning. We
had killed some 250 to 300 of them, which will be a lesson
to them, I hope. My men got into the village contiguous
to the fort early, while we pitched into those of the
enemy who remained behind, to a great extent. Since
then we have been pursuing other parties, but only came
into collision with them to a very trifling extent once.
They had learnt how to run away beautifully. The Brigadier
has grown quite active, and <i>very fond of me</i> since
that day at Kul&aacute;llw&aacute;la, though he had the wit to see how
very "brown I had done him" by making him march
two marches in one.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>

<i>Jan. 1849.</i>
</p>

<p>I have just completed the first series of my duties in
this Do&acirc;b, by driving the last party of the insurgents
across the Chenab.</p>

<p>As soon as I had settled matters a little at Deenanuggur,
and made some arrangements to prevent further
troubles if possible, I crossed the Ravee again, and got
upon the track of the rebel party who had given us so
much trouble. On the 15th, I heard that a large party
had collected at a village called Gumrolah (near Dufferwal),
but they had so many spies in my camp, that it was
difficult to avoid their ken; at the same time their tendency
to run away made a surprise the only feasible
mode of reaching them. We therefore turned in as usual
at night, but soon after midnight I aroused my men, and
got them under arms and off before any one was aware
of our move. I had with me one hundred of my Guides
and fifteen sowars.</p>

<p>We marched quietly but swiftly, all night, and came
upon the insurgents just at daybreak. I had ridden
forward about half a mile, with a couple of sowars, to
reconnoitre, and got unobserved within 250 yards of the
insurgents, numbering at least 150 horse and foot.</p>

<p>They looked at me, and hesitated whether to come at
me or not, apparently, while I beckoned to the remaining
sowars to come up. I was in great hopes that they would
have waited for ten minutes, by which time my men
would have been up, with their rifles, and we should have
given a good account of them. However, before five
minutes had elapsed, they moved off sulkily like a herd
of frightened deer, half alarmed, half in doubt. I saw
at once that there was but one chance left, and determined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
to go at them as I was,&mdash;though 15 to 150 is an
imprudent attempt.</p>

<p>The instant we were in motion they fled, and had gone
half a mile before we could overtake them; the mounted
men got off, but a party of Akhalees<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> on foot stopped
and fought us, in some instances very fiercely. One fine
bold "Nihung" beat off four sowars one after another,
and kept them all at bay. I then went at him myself,
fearing that he would kill one of them. He instantly
rushed to meet me like a tiger, closed with me, yelling,
"Wah Gooroo ji," and accompanying each shout with a
terrific blow of his tulwar. I guarded the three or four
first, but he pressed so closely to my horse's rein that I
could not get a fair cut in return. At length I pressed
in my turn upon him so sharply that he missed his blow,
and I caught his tulwar backhanded with my bridle hand,
wrenched it from him, and cut him down with the right,
having received no further injury than a severe cut across
the fingers; I never beheld such desperation and fury in
my life. It was not <i>human</i> scarcely. By this time the
rest of the party had gone a long way, and as we had
already pursued farther than was prudent, where the
spectators even were armed, and awaiting the result, I
was obliged to halt, not without a growl at General
Wheeler for having left me without any men. We had
killed one more than our own number, however, and five
more were so severely wounded that they were removed
on "charpoys."

<p>I insert here a portion of Sir F. Currie's despatch

<p>"The affair at Buddee Pind was a most gallant
one,&mdash;far more so than Lieutenant Hodson's
modest statement in his letter would lead
me to suppose. I have accounts from parties
who were eye-witnesses to the personal gallantry
and energy of Lieutenant Hodson, by whose
hand, in single conflict, the Akhalee, mentioned
in paragraph 5, fell, after he had beaten off four
horsemen of the 15th Native Cavalry, and to
whose bold activity and indefatigable exertions,
and the admirable arrangements made by him,
with the small means at his disposal, the successful
issue of this expedition is to be attributed."

<p>To this his Lordship replied as follows, through

and with the mode in which he discharges
whatever duty is intrusted to him. The Governor-General

the activity, energy, and intelligence of his
proceedings, and he has added to the exercise of
the same qualities on this occasion an exhibition

of personal gallantry which the Governor-General

<p>... A few days afterwards, Lumsden having joined me
with our mounted men, we surprised and cut to pieces
another party of rebels, for which we have again been
thanked by Government. Since then I have been with
Brigadier-General Wheeler's force again, employed in
hunting after one Ram Singh and his followers, and have
been day and night at work,&mdash;examining the hills and
rivers, trying fords, leading columns, and doing all the
multifarious duties thrust on that unhappy combination
of hard work, a "Guide" and "Political" in one.
Ram Singh's position was stormed on the 16th, and I had
been chosen to lead one of the principal columns of
attack; but we had to march by a circuitous route across
the hills, darkness came on, accompanied by dreadful
rain, the rivers rose and were impassable, and after
twenty-four hours of the most trying work I ever experienced,
in which cold, hunger, and wet were our enemies,
we succeeded in reaching our ground just in time to be
too late; however, I had done all that human nature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
could effect under the circumstances, and one cannot
always be successful. Two poor fellows, one a nephew

trifling on our side.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

fight between the army under Lord Gough and the

it will be called a victory and lauded accordingly. Oh

<p>I had one of my narrowest escapes two days ago: I went
into Lahore for a few days to see Sir H. Lawrence (who
is again the Resident), and laid relays of horses along the
road to this place, so as to ride in at once. I left Lahore
on the morning of the 31st, and stopping at Umritsur to
breakfast, reached my camp at nightfall, having ridden
one hundred miles in ten hours and a half. A party of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
Sikhs had collected at a village by the roadside to attack
me and "polish" me off, but not calculating upon the
rapidity of my movements, did not expect me until the
morning. I am sorry to say that they surrounded my
horses which were coming on quietly in the morning,
asked for me, and finding I had escaped, stole my best
horse (a valuable Arab, who had carried me in three
fights), and bolted, not, however, without resistance, for
two horsemen (Guides) of mine who were with the horse
tried to save it. One got four wounds and the other escaped
unhurt. Had I ridden like any other Christian
instead of like a spectre horseman, and been the usual
time on the road, I should have been "a body." We
gave chase from hence as soon as we heard, and rode for
eleven hours and a half in pursuit! which was pretty
well after a hundred miles' ride the day before.</p>

<p>I have at length reached the "army of the Punjaub,"
almost by accident, as it were, though I was most anxious
to be present at the final grand struggle between the
Khalsa and the British armies. I am at present with
my men, attached to a brigade encamped on this (the
left) bank of the Chenab, to prevent the enemy crossing
until Lord Gough is ready to attack them on the right
bank, where he is now encamped with his whole force
minus our brigade. The Sikhs quietly walked away
from him the other day, and instead of having their
backs to the Jhelum, passed round his flank, and made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
steadily for this place, intending, boldly enough, to march
upon Lahore. I came across the Do&acirc;b with a handful
of men, and reached this place just as they took up a
position on the opposite bank of the river. At the same
moment a brigade arrived by a forced night-march from
Ramnuggur, and, for the present, the Sikhs have been
<i>sold</i>. Yet I should not be surprised at their evading us
again, and going off to a higher ford. The game is getting
very exciting, and I am quite enjoying the stir and
bustle of two large armies in the field. The grand finale
must, one would think, come off in a day or two. It is
possible however that, as I say, the Sikhs may out-man&oelig;uvre
us and prolong the campaign. The Affghans
have joined the Sikhs, contrary to the expectations of
every one (but myself), and there is now no saying where
the struggle will end.</p>

<p class="ch_summ">
ANNEXATION OF PUNJAUB.&mdash;INCREASE OF CORPS OF
GUIDES AT PESHAWUR.&mdash;TRANSFER TO CIVIL DEPARTMENT
AS ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left65">
<i>April 17th, 1849.</i>
</p>

<p>You will have heard of the great events of the last
month; how on the 26th March, the Punjaub became
"forever" a British Province, governed by a Triumvirate;
and how the Koh-i-noor was appropriated as a
present to the Queen,&mdash;and all the rest of it; you may
imagine the turmoil and unrest of this eventful time; but
I defy you to imagine the confusion of the process which
converts a wild native kingdom into a police-ridden and
civilian-governed country.</p>

<p>I had anticipated and wished for this measure. I did
not, however, expect that it would be carried out so suddenly
and so sweepingly as it has been....</p>

<p>I have been <i>annexed</i> as well as the Punjaub! my "occupation's
gone," and although efforts have been and are
making for my restoration to "the department," yet at
present I am shelved. I shall know more next month.
Meanwhile, I am off with the new Commissioner to instruct
him in the details of his province, which I had
governed and <i>won</i> from the rebels during the last six
months, but in which I am not now accounted worthy to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
be a humble assistant. There's fame! Well, something
will turn up, I suppose. I hope to remain here, however,
under the Commissioner, for a time, that I may get acquainted
with this wonderful civil system. It is as well
to know how the mill works.</p>

<p>I got quite fond of Lord Gough. I was his guest at
Lahore for a month, and his noble character and fire
made one condone his mistakes.</p>

<p>We are now on the "<i>qui vive</i>" for his successor. I
long for Sir C. Napier, but the Court of Directors seem
determined to hold out.</p>

<p>The Guides are at Peshawur, where I shall probably
join them.
</p>
</div>

<p>Lieutenant Hodson's descent in position, upon
the annexation of the Punjaub, was, perhaps, unavoidable,
though it was very natural that he
should feel it. So soon as the country was placed
under the government of the East India Company,
the regulations of the service with regard
to seniority of course took effect, and it was not
to be expected that a subaltern of less than five
years' standing should be continued in so important
a charge, however well qualified he might
have proved himself for it in the most trying
times. His position altogether had been a peculiar
and exceptional one.</p>

<p>We shall see, however, that his disappointment
did not prevent his throwing himself with his
usual energy into whatever duties were assigned
to him.

</p>

<p>My stay here is very uncertain. I merely came to
settle affairs with Lumsden relative to the increase of
the Guides. Meantime, I have been much interested
with my first visit to this Affghan province and to the
Indus. You will see at once that though it gives us a
very strong military frontier, only passable to armies in
half a dozen points, and therefore infinitely less difficult
to hold than a long line of river, which is ever "a silent
highway for nations," yet at the same time we have once
more established a footing in Affghanistan from which
there is no receding, as we did when we went as allies
to the puppet Shah Soojah. Our next stride must be to
Her&acirc;t, I fancy; <i>when</i> the day will come no man can say,
but "the uncontrollable principle," which, according to
Sir R. Peel, took us there before, will not be the less active
in its operation now that we have no longer the court
and camp of Runjeet Singh between us and these wild
tribes. It is to be hoped that "the uncontrollable principle"
will not appear so very like an <i>un</i>controllable want
of it as it did in days gone by! However, go we must,
and shall <i>some</i> day,&mdash;so hurrah for Cabul!</p>

<p>I wish you would hit upon some plan for keeping me
more "au fait" with the events of your home world.
My time has been occupied so constantly since I came to
India, that, though I may have made some progress in
the knowledge of <i>men</i>, I have made but little in that of
<i>books</i>. We are sadly off for military works in English,
and few sciences require more study than the art of war.
You might get me a list of good works from the "United
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
Service Institution" at Charing Cross. I want the best
edition of C&aelig;sar procurable; also Xenophon and Arrian.
I fancy the last has been very well edited.

<p>This is the first time I have written to you from
Affghanistan. Who shall say whence my letters may be
directed within a few months. Are we to advance on
Cabul and Candahar, and plant the Union Jack once
more on the towers of Ghuznee? or are we to lie peacefully

<p>My own belief is, that I shall live to see both the places
I have mentioned, and Her&acirc;t, occupied by British troops;
at least, I hope so.</p>

<p>I think I told you how it had pleased the Governor-General
to reward "my distinguished services," toils,
troubles, and dangers, by kicking me out of the coach
altogether. Did I not? Well, after that close to my
civil duties, after having "initiated" the new Commissioner
into his duties, I was sent up hither to augment
recruits and train the Guides. And now daily, morning
and evening, I may be seen standing on one leg to convince
their Affghan mind of the plausibility and elegance
of the goose step. I am quite a sergeant-major just now,
and you will well believe that your wandering brother is
sufficiently cosmopolized to drop with a certain "aplomb"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
into any line of life which may turn up in the course
of his career. I was always fond of "soldiering," and
there is a species of absurdity in dropping from the
minister of a province into a drill-sergeant, which is
enlivening. By the next mail I may have to report my
transformation into some new animal. So "vive la
gloire."

<p>I hope that you got my letter about sending me books.
There is a remarkable dearth of them here just now.
You know it was a flying column which came on here
after Goojerat, composed of regiments hurried up to the
field from Bombay, Scinde, and Hindostan. They came in
light marching order. Books are not a part of that style
of equipment. Suddenly a Government order consigned
them to Peshawur, for seven months at least,&mdash;10,000
men, with an unusually large number of Europeans and
officers, <i>and no books</i>! Pleasant during the confinement
caused by the hot season. I was better off, because, being
a nomad by profession, I carry a few books as a part
even of the lightest equipment, but I have read them all
till I am tired, except Shakspeare. <i>My</i> time is pretty
fully occupied, but there are dozens of regimental officers
who have not an hour's work in two days, and I do pity
them from my heart. Then of course there are no ladies
here, and consequently no society, or <i>r&eacute;unions</i>, (as they
are called when people <i>live</i> together,) and people are
pitched headlong on to their own resources, and find them
very <i>hard falling indeed</i>! I have nothing personal to
tell you, except that when the last mail went out I was in
bed with a sharp attack of fever, which left me without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
strength, flesh, or appetite,&mdash;a regular blazing eastern
fever, the sort of thing which burns so fast, that if it don't
stop quickly, it burns you well down into the socket,
and leaves you there without strength to splutter or
flicker, and you go out without the satisfaction of a last
flare-up at expiring. I am thankful to say I am well
again now, and picking up strength fast.</p>

<p>They are increasing our corps of Guides to 1,000 men,
so that I shall have enough on my hands, especially as
our Commandant leaves almost everything to me. Sir H.
Lawrence writes from Simla that I am to be appointed
an Assistant Commissioner under the new Board of Administration.
I was the only one of the late Assistants
to the Resident who was not included at first in the new

<p>On my arrival here I found your note of 18th June.
You may imagine how wild I was with pleasure at
seeing your handwriting again, as I had been deeply
anxious since the arrival of my father's and George's
letters of the 4th June. These brought me the first
tidings of our darling's death. Happily I saw no newspaper
by that mail, and the black edges first startled me
from the belief that you were all well and happy. The
blow was a bitter one indeed, and its utter suddenness
was appalling. Indeed, the prevailing impression on my
mind for days was simple unbelief of the reality of that
sweet child's actual death. I have been so long <i>alone</i>,&mdash;home
has been for so long a time more a pleasant dream
than a reality,&mdash;I have been for so many a weary day,
as it were, dead to you all, and the sense of separation has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
grown so completely into one's being, that I find it difficult
to separate that which it is possible to see again from
that which is impossible. Thus it seems to me incredible
that any greater barrier can sever me from this darling
child than that ever-present one which divides me from
all of you. Can you understand this? I know it to be
a delusion, and yet I cannot shake it off. Yet 'tis a
good delusion in one way. It deadens the sense of grief
which the full realization of her death would overwhelm
me with.</p>

<p>I have been unfortunate again, and had a second sharp
attack of fever since my arrival. I am about again, but
not able to work. Sir H. Lawrence is very unwell; I
fear that his constitution is utterly broken down, and that
he will either have to go away from India for two years
or more, or that another hot season will kill him. He is
ten years older in every respect than he was during our
Cashmere trip in 1846. This is a hard, wearing, dry
climate, which, though preferable to Hindostan, is destructive
to the weak and sickly. It is quite sad to feel how,
little by little, one's strength and muscle and energy fade,
and how one can perceive age creeping in upon one so
early.

<p>You know that I have left the Guides (alas!) and have
been transformed into a complete civilian, doomed to pass
the rest of my career in the administrative and executive
duties of the Government of this last acquisition of the
English in India. To tell the truth, I had much rather
have remained with the Guides; a more independent,
and very far pleasanter life, and I think one that will in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
the end be more distinguished. However, I was guided
by Mr. Thomason's and Sir H. Lawrence's advice, and
must take the consequences. It would be difficult to define
or explain the exact nature of my new calling, but
in brief, you will comprehend that in their respective districts
the Deputy Assistant Commissioners perform the
whole of the judicial, fiscal, and magisterial duties which
devolve upon the Government of a country in Europe,
with the addition of collecting from the cultivators and
landholders the rent of all lands under cultivation and
pasture, and the duties which in Europe devolve on an
owner of landed property. Police, jails, quarter-sessions,
committals to prison, jury, judge, excise, stamps, taxes,
roads, bridges, ferries, woods and forests, and finally rent!
think what these imply, and you will form some idea of
the employment of an official in the Punjaub under the
"Board of Administration." I have not yet dipped very
deep into this turbid stream of ever-recurring work, since
the great amount of arrears consequent on the break-up
of one Government, and the establishment of another,
including the paying-up and discharge of vast civil and
military establishments, have rendered it necessary to employ
any available head and pair of hands for some
months at head-quarters. The army has fallen to my
share, and I have to examine into the claims of innumerable
fine old hangers-on of the Lahore State to grants or
pensions, to record their rights, and report on them for
the decision of Government. Then there are upwards of
2,000 old women, wives and mothers of soldiers killed in
war, whom I have to see and pay the pittance decreed by
their masters. Lord Dalhousie, and his secretaries and
officials, are stern and hard taskmasters, and are not unworthily
represented by the new Board, the only merciful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
member of which (Sir H. Lawrence) is left in a minority,
and is, moreover, too ill to do much.</p>

<p>I at length got away from Lahore on the 7th. I had
been ordered merely to seek change of air, but Sir H.
Lawrence was starting on a long tour of inspection, and
offered me the option of accompanying him, and doing a
little work by the way, which I very much preferred; so
here we are, after visiting the sacred city of Umritsur,
and the scenes of my last year's adventures in Butala,
Deenanuggur, and Shahpoor, all between the Ravee and
Beas; and are now on our way to the mountain stations
of Kangra, &amp;c. We then go to the westward again, and
I hope to see</p>

<p>as I have dubbed the Indus, ere we again return to civil
life, which does not suit my temperament or taste half as
well as this more nomad life. I am able to ride again,
though not quite with the same firmness, in the saddle as
of yore. I have no doubt, however, that ere we do see
the "Borysthenes," I shall be as "game" for a gallop of
one hundred miles on end, as I was last year at this season.</p>

<p>I am at last in a fair way of being stationary for a time
at Umritsur, the sacred city of the Sikhs, and a creation
entirely of their genius. Lahore, as of course you know,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
was the old Mussulman capital, and was not built by the
Sikhs, though used by them as the seat of government
and head-quarters of the army. Umritsur is larger than
Lahore by a third or more of people, and half as much
again of space. It is five miles in circumference, very
strongly fortified, and covered by the fortress of Govindghur
on the west, and by a large fortified garden on the
north. I am Assistant Commissioner under the Deputy
Commissioner in charge of the district, Mr. Saunders, a
civilian, a very nice sort of fellow, with an exceedingly
pretty and nice wife. Mr. Montgomery is our Commissioner.
I like all I have seen of him very much indeed.
He is a very able man, and at the head of his service in
many respects. Lahore is only about thirty-five miles
hence,&mdash;quite within visiting distance in India.</p>

<p>You must not talk of getting "acclimatized." There
is no way of becoming so but by avoiding the climate as
much as possible. I have had a bad time of it since I
left Peshawur, three and a half months almost entirely
on my back, which reduced me terribly. Then just as I
was getting well, the other day I had a fit of jaundice,
which has only just left me; altogether, in health and in
prospects I have come "down in my luck" to a considerable
extent; not that, <i>per se</i>, I ought, as a subaltern of
not quite five years' service, to grumble at my present
position, if I was now starting in the line for the first
time; but I can't forget that I came into the Punjaub two
years and a half ago, and have had no little of the "burden
and heat of the day" to bear, when to do so required
utter disregard of comfort and personal safety and of rest.
It is now two years since I was made an Assistant to the
Resident, and within a few months of that time I took
absolute charge of a tract of country (in a state of war,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
too) comprising three modern districts, in one of which I
am now playing third fiddle. Surely annexation was a
"heavy blow and a great discouragement" to me, at
least. In the military line, too, I have been equally unlucky,
from the fact of my services having been with detachments
instead of with the main army. I held my
ground (and cleared it of the enemy, too) for weeks, with
only 120 men at my back, and when every officer, from
General Wheeler downwards, entreated me to withdraw
and give it up; I fed 5,000 men and horses for six
months by personal and unremitting exertion; collected
the revenues of the disturbed districts, and paid 15,000<i>l.</i>
over and above, into the treasury, from the proceeds of
property taken from the rebels. Besides this, I worked
for General Wheeler so satisfactorily, that he has declared
publicly that he could have done nothing without me. So
much were the Sikhs enraged<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> at my proceedings, that
party after party were sent to "<i>polish</i>" me off, and at one
time I couldn't stir about the country without having bullets
sent at my head from every bush and wall. However,
I need not go on with the catalogue, I have been
egotistical enough as it is. The "reward" for these services
was losing my civil appointment, and being reduced
to half pay or little more for three months, and the distinction
of being the only subaltern mentioned in despatches
for whom nothing has been done either "in
pr&aelig;senti" or "in prospectu." "Had your name been
Hay or Ramsay," said General Wheeler to me the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
day, "no honors, no appointments, no distinctions would
have been considered too great to mark the services you
have rendered to Government." Well, we shall live to
see more wars, or I am sadly mistaken, and <i>then</i>&mdash;I
leave you to finish the sentence.

<p>
Speaking of the system of the Indian army:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left65">
<i>March 18th, 1850.</i>
</p>

<p>At the age at which officers become colonels and majors,
not one in fifty is able to stand the wear and tear
of Indian service. They become still more worn in mind
than in body. All elasticity is gone; all energy and enterprise
worn out; they become, after a fortnight's campaign,
a burden to themselves, an annoyance to those
under them, and a terror to every one but the enemy!
The officer who commanded the cavalry brigade which
so disgraced the service at Chillianwalla, was not able to
mount a horse without the assistance of two men. A
brigadier of infantry, under whom I served during the
three most critical days of the late war, could not see his
regiment when I led his horse by the bridle until its nose
touched the bayonets; and even then he said faintly,
"Pray which way are the men facing, Mr. Hodson?"
This is no exaggeration, I assure you. Can you wonder
that our troops have to recover by desperate fighting, and
with heavy loss, the advantages thrown away by the want
of heads and eyes to lead them?</p>

<p>A seniority service, like that of the Company, is all
very well for poor men; better still for fools, for they
must rise equally with wise men; but for maintaining
the discipline and efficiency of the army in time of peace,
and hurling it on the enemy in war, there never was a
system which carried so many evils on its front and face.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span></p>

<p>I speak strongly, you will say, for I feel acutely;
though I am so young a soldier, yet the whole of my
brief career has been spent in camps, and a year such as
the last, spent in almost constant strife, and a great part
of it on detached and independent command, teaches one
lessons which thirty years of peaceful life, of parades and
cantonments, would never impart.</p>

<p>There are men of iron, like Napier and Radetzky,
aged men, whom nothing affects; but they are just in
sufficient numbers to prove the rule by establishing exceptions.
Depend upon it, that for the rough work of
war, especially in India, your leaders must be young to
be effective.</p>

<p>If you <i>could</i> but see my beautiful rough and ready
boys, with their dirt colored clothes and swarthy faces,
lying in wait for a Sikh, I think it would amuse you not
a little. I must try and send you a picture of them.
Alas! I am no longer a "Guide," but only a big-wig,
administering justice, deciding disputes, imprisoning
thieves, and assisting to hang highwaymen, like any other
poor old, fat, respectable, humdrum justice of the peace
in Old England.

<p>I quite agree with all you say about Arnold. His loss
was a national misfortune. Had he lived, he would have
produced an impression on men's minds whose effects
would have been felt for ages. As it is, the influence
which he did produce has been most lasting and striking
in its effects. It is felt even in India; I cannot say more
than <i>that</i>.</p>

<p>You should come and live in India for five years if you
wished to feel (supposing you ever doubted it) the benefit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
of our "established" forms of Christianity. Even the
outward signs and tokens of its profession&mdash;cathedrals,
churches, colleges, tombs, hospitals, almshouses&mdash;have,
I am now more than ever convinced, an influence on
men's minds and principles and actions which none but
those who have been removed from their influence for
years can feel or appreciate thoroughly. The more I
think of this, the more strongly I feel the effect of mere
external sights and sounds on the inner and better man.
Our Gothic buildings, our religious-looking churches, have,
I am sure, a more restraining and pacifying influence than
is generally believed by those who are habituated to them,
and have never felt the want of them. A few cathedrals
and venerable-looking edifices would do wonders in our
colonies. Here we have nothing physical to remind us
of any creed but Islamism and Hindooism. The comparative
purity of the Moslem's creed is shown admirably
in the superiority in taste and form of their places of
prayer. Christianity alone is thrust out of sight! A
barrack-room, a ball-room, a dining-room, perhaps a court
of justice, serve the purpose for which the "wisdom and
piety of our ancestors" constructed such noble and stately
temples; feeling, justly, that the human mind in its weakness
required to be called to the exercise of devotion by
the senses as well as by reason and will; that separation
from the ordinary scenes of every-day life, its cares, its
toils, its amusements, is necessary to train the feelings
and thoughts to that state in which religious impressions
are conveyed. I have not seen a church for three years
and more, nor heard the service of the Church read, save
at intervals, in a room in which, perhaps, the night before,
I had been crushed by a great dinner party, or worn out
by the bustle and turmoil of suitors. The building in
which one toils becomes intimately associated with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
toil itself. That in which one prays should at least have
some attribute to remind one of prayer. Human nature
shrinks for long from the thought of being buried in any
but consecrated ground; the certainty of lying dead some
day or other on a field of battle, or by a roadside, has, I
have remarked, the most strange effect on the soldier's
mind. Depend upon it the same feeling holds good with
regard to consecrated places of worship. You may think
this fanciful, but I am sure you would feel it more strongly
than I do, were you to live for a time in a country where
everything <i>but religion</i> has its living and existent memorials
and evidences.</p>

<p>But to return to reality: I have just spent three days
in Sir Charles Napier's camp, it being my duty to accompany
him through such parts of the civil district as he
may have occasion to visit. He was most kind and cordial,
vastly amusing and interesting, and gave me even a
higher opinion of him than before. To be sure his language
and mode of expressing himself savor more of
the last than of this century,&mdash;of the camp than of the
court; but barring these eccentricities, he is a wonderful
man; his heart is as thoroughly in his work, and he takes
as high a tone in all that concerns it, as Arnold did in his;
that is to say, the highest the subject is capable of. I only
trust he will remain with us as long as his health lasts,
and endeavor to rouse the army from the state of slack
discipline into which it has fallen. On my parting with
him he said, "Now, remember, Hodson, if there is any
way in which I can be of use to you, pray don't scruple to
write to me." I didn't show him his brother's<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> letter,&mdash;that
he might judge for himself first, and know me "per
se," or rather "per me;" I will, however, if ever I see
him again.</p>

<p>Your letter from Paris reached me just as I was
preparing to start from Umritsur to join Sir Henry
Lawrence, and accompany him to Cashmere. I fought
against the necessity of leave as long as possible, but I
was getting worse and worse daily, and so much weakened
from the effects of heat and hard work acting on a
frame already reduced by sickness, that I was compelled
to be off ere worse came. We yesterday arrived at the
summit of the first high ridge southward of the snowy
range, and have now only some sixty miles to traverse
before entering the valley. To me, travelling is life, and
in a country where one has no home, no local attractions,
and no special sympathies, it is the greatest comfort in
the world. I get terribly <i>ennuy&eacute;</i> if I am in one place
for three months at a time; yet I think I should be just
as tame as ever in England, quite domestic again.

<span class="smcap">Cashmere</span>, <i>July 8th, 1850</i>.

<p>You would enjoy this lovely valley extremely. I did
not know it was so beautiful, having only seen it before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
in its winter dress. Nothing can exceed the luxuriant
beauty of the vegetation, the plane-trees and walnuts especially,
except the squalor, dirt, and poverty of the wretched
Cashmerians. The King is avaricious, and is old.
The disease grows on him, and he wont look beyond his
money-bags. There is a capitation tax on every individual
practising any labor, trade, profession, or employment,
collected <i>daily</i>. Fancy the Londoners having to
go and pay a fourpenny and a sixpenny bit each, per
diem, for the pleasure of living in the town. Then the
tax on all shawls, goods, and fabrics, is about seventy-five
per cent., including custom duty; and this the one solitary
staple of the valley. The chief crops are rice, and
of this, what with one half taken at a slap as "revenue,"
or rent, and sundry other pulls for dues, taxes, and offerings,
so little remains to the farmer, that in practice he
pays <i>all</i>, or within a few bushels of all, his produce to
the King, and secures in return <i>his food</i>, and that not of
the best. Thus the farmer class, or "Zemindars," are
reduced pretty well to the state of day-laborers; yet the
people are all well clothed, and fuel is to be had for the
asking. What a garden it might be made. Not an acre
to which the finest water might not be conveyed without
expense worth naming, and a climate where all produce
comes to perfection, from wheat and barley to grapes and
silk. We go northwards on the 20th, first to Lad&acirc;kh
and Thibet, thence to Iskardo, and then across the Indus
to Gilghit, a <i>terra incognita</i> to which, I believe, only one
European now living has penetrated. Sir Henry Lawrence
is not well, and certainly not up to this trip, but he
has made up his mind to go. I do not gain strength as
fast as I could wish, but I fancy when once thoroughly
unstrung, it takes a long time to recover the wonted tone.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span></p>

<p>We shall have another frontier war in the cold weather
evidently, and I fancy a more prolonged and complete
affair than the last. The cause of the only loss sustained
in the last scrimmage was the panic of the Sepoys.
They are as children in the hands of these Affghans and
hill tribes. Our new Punjaub levies fought "like bricks,"
but the Hindostanee is not a hardy enough animal, physically
or morally, to contend with the sturdier races west
of the Sutlej, or the active and fighting "Path&agrave;ns." The
very <i>name</i> sticks in John Sepoy's throat. I must try and
see the next contest, but I do not quite see my way to
it at present.

<p>Who would have thought of my writing to you from
Thibet. I am sitting in a little tent about eight feet long,
which just takes a narrow cot, a table, and chair of camp
dimensions, and my <i>sac-de-nuit</i>, gun, &amp;c., and a tin box
containing books, papers, and the materials for this present
epistle. Under the same tree (a veritable chestnut)
is Sir Henry Lawrence's tent, a ditto of mine, in which
he is comfortably sleeping, as I ought to be; outside are
my pets,&mdash;that is, a string of mules who accompany me
in all my travels, and have also in the mountains the
honor of carrying me as well as my baggage. The
kitchen is under a neighboring tree; and round a fire are
squatting our gallant guards, a party of Maharaja Gholab
Singh's household brigade. Some of his people accompany
us, and what with followers, a Moonshee or two for
business, and their followers, I dare say we are a party
of two or three hundred souls, of all colors and creeds,&mdash;Christians,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
Mussulmans, Hindoos, Buddhists, Sikhs, and
varieties of each. The creeds of the party are as varied
as their colors; and that's saying a good deal, when you
contrast my white face and yellow hair with Sir Henry's
nut-brown, the pale white parchmenty-color of the Kashmeree,
the honest brunette tinge of the tall Sikh, the clear
olive-brown of the Rajpoot, down through all shades of
dinginess to the deep black of the low-caste Hindoo. I
am one of the whitest men in India, I fancy, as, instead
of burning in the sun, I get blanched like endive or
celery. How you would stare at my long beard, moustache,
and whiskers. However, to return from such personalities
to facts. The Indus is brawling along five
hundred feet below us, as if in a hurry to get "out of
that;" and above, one's neck aches with trying to see to
the top of the vast craggy mountains which confine the
stream in its rocky channel. So wild, so heaven-forsaken
a scene I never beheld; living nature there is none.
In a week's journey, I have seen three marmots, two
wag-tails, and three jackdaws; and we have averaged
twenty miles a day.</p>

<p>We met a lady the other day, in the most romantic
way possible, in the midst of the very wildest of glens,
and almost as wild weather. She is a young and very
pretty creature, gifted with the most indomitable energy
and endurance (except as regards her husband, whom she
<i>can't</i> endure, and therefore travels alone). But conceive,
that for the last three months she has been making her
way on pony-back across a country which few <i>men</i> would
like to traverse, over the most formidable passes, the
deepest and rapidest rivers, and wildest deserts in Asia.
For twenty days she was in the extreme wilds of Thibet,
without ever seeing a human habitation; making such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
long day's journeys as often to be without food or bedding,
traversing passes from sixteen to eighteen thousand
feet above the sea, where you can hardly breathe without
pain; enduring pain, sickness, and every other mortal ill,
yet persevering still! Poor creature, she is dying, I fear.
It is evident that she is in a deep consumption, created
by a terrible fall she had down a precipice, at the commencement
of her journey. Well, one day we met her
between this place and Cashmere. She was sixteen or
twenty miles from her tents, and the rain and darkness
were coming on apace; the thermometer down below
fifty degrees. So we persuaded her to stop at our encampment.
I gave her my tent and cot, acted lady's
maid, supplied her with warm stockings and shoes,
water, towels, brushes, &amp;c., and made her comfortable,
and then we sat down to dinner; and a pleasanter
evening I never spent. She was as gay as a lark, and
poured out stores of information and anecdotes, and
recounted her adventures in the "spiritedest" manner.
After an early breakfast the next morning, I put her on
her pony, and she went on her way, and we saw her no
more. I hope she will live to reach the end of her
journey, and not die in some wild mountain-side unattended
and alone.

<p>... Until you cross the mountain chain which separates
Cashmere from Tibet (or Thibet), all is green and
beautiful. It is impossible to imagine a finer combination
of vast peaks and masses of mountain, with green sloping
lawns, luxuriant foliage, and fine clustering woods, than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
is displayed on the sides of the great chain which we
usually call the Himalaya, but which is better described
as the ridge which separates the waters of the Jhelum,
Chenab, Ravee, and Beas from those of the Indus.
When once, however, you have crossed this vast barrier,
the scene changes as if by magic, and you have nothing
but huge convulsive-looking masses of rock, tremendous
mountains, glaciers, snow, and valleys which are more
vast watercourses than anything else. On the more open
and less elevated spots along these various feeders of the
Indus, one comes to little patches of cultivation, rising
from the banks of the rivers in tiers of carefully prepared
terraces, and irrigated by channels carried along
the sides of the hill from a point higher up the stream.
Here, in scattered villages ten and twenty miles apart,
live the ugliest race on earth, I should imagine, whom
we call Thibetians, but who style themselves "Bhots" or
"Bhods," and unite the characteristic features, or rather
want of them, of both Goorkhas and Chinese. I went
yesterday to see a monastery of their Llamas, the most
curious sight, as well as <i>site</i>, I ever beheld. Perched on
the summit of a mass of sandstone-grit, conglomerate
pudding-stone, worn by the melting snows (for there is
no rain in Tibet) into miraculous cones, steeples, and pinnacles
rising abruptly from the valley to the height of
600 feet, are a collection of queer little huts, connected
together by bridges, passages, and staircases. In these
dwell the worthies who have betaken themselves to the
life of religious mendicants and priests. They seem to
correspond exactly with the travelling friars of olden
times. Half stay at home to perform chants and services
in their convent chapel, and half go a-begging about the
country. They are not a distinct race like the Brahmins
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
of India, but each Bhot peasant devotes one of two or
three sons to the church, and he is thenceforward devoted
to a life of celibacy, of shaven crown, of crimson apparel,
of mendicancy, of idleness, and of comfort. They all
acknowledge spiritual allegiance to the great Llama at
Llassa (some two months' journey from Lad&acirc;kh), by
whom the abbot of each convent is appointed on a vacancy
occurring, and to whom all their proceedings are
reported. Nunneries also exist on precisely the same
footing. I saw a few of the nuns, and their hideous appearance
fully justified their adoption of celibacy and
seclusion. From their connection with almost every
family, as I have said, they are universally looked up to
and supported as a class by the people. Even Hindoos
reverence them; and their power is not only feared, but
I fancy tolerably freely exercised. Their chapel (a flat-roofed
square building supported on pillars) is furnished
with parallel rows of low benches to receive the squatting
fathers. Their services consist of chants and recitative,
accompanied by the <i>dis</i>cord of musical(?) instruments and
drums, while perpetual lamps burn on the altars before
their idols, and a sickly perfume fills the air. Round the
room are rude shelves containing numberless volumes of
religious books; not bound, but in separate leaves secured
between two painted boards. I will try and send you
one, if I can corrupt the mind of some worthy Llama
with profane silver. They are genuine <i>block books</i>,
strange to say, apparently carved on wood, and then
stamped on a Chinese paper. The figures of their images,
and their costume and head-dress (<i>i.e.</i>, of the images),
are Chinese entirely, not at all resembling the
Bhot dress, or scarcely so, and though fashioned by
Thibetian hands, you might fancy yourself gazing on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
figures in the Chinese Exhibition at Hyde-Park Corner.
Their language is a sealed book to me, of course, and
though they all read and write well, yet they were unable
to explain the meaning of the words they were
repeating. The exterior appearance and sites of their
conventual buildings reminded me very strongly of the
drawings I saw in a copy of Curzon's "Monasteries of the
Levant," which fell in my way for five minutes one day.
I need hardly say that, in a country composed of mountains
ranging from 14,000 feet upwards, the scenery is
magnificent in the extreme, though very barren and
savage. Apricots and wheat are ripening in the valley
whence I now write (on the right bank of the Indus,
some fifty miles below the town of Lad&acirc;kh), and snow is
glistening on the summits above me; the roads have
been very easy indeed, and enabled us to make long
day's marches, from sixteen to twenty-five miles. This
is more than you could do in two days in the ranges
south of the Himalaya, with due regard for your own
bones, and the cattle or porters which carry your traps
and tents. I am very seedy, and twenty miles is more
than I can ride with comfort (that I should live to say
it). I have not as yet derived much, if any, benefit from
change of climate.</p>

<p>From Lad&acirc;kh we go to Iskardo, some twelve marches
lower down the Indus, where it has been joined by the
water of Yarkund; and thence to Gilghit, a valley running
up from that of the Indus, still lower down, and
bordering on Budakhstan. We (Sir Henry Lawrence
and I) then return to Cashmere; I expect it will be two
more months' journey. We have already been out a
fortnight, and it is very fatiguing. I am not sure that I
was wise in undertaking it, but he (Lawrence) is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
greater invalid than I am, and two or three men fought
shy of the task of accompanying him.

</p>

<p>Only think of my sitting down peaceably to write to
you from this outside world. Had I lived a hundred
years ago, I should have been deemed a great traveller,
and considered to have explored unknown countries, and
unknown they are, only the principal danger of visiting
them is past, seeing that they have been subdued by a
power (Gholab Singh) with whom we have "relations."
Yet if I were to cross the mountains which stare me in
the face a few miles off, I should be carried off and sold
for a slave. It were vain to try to compress the scenes
of a two months' journey into a sheet of note-paper. We
have travelled very rapidly. Few men go the pace Sir
Henry Lawrence does. So we have covered a great extent
of country in the past month; and seeing that the
valleys are the only inhabited parts of the country, the
rest being huge masses of mountains, one really sees in
these rapid flights all that is to be seen of the abodes of
man. We have collected a good deal of information too,
which, if I had time to arrange it, might be of value.
We were eleven long days' journey from Cashmere to
Lad&acirc;kh, besides halts on the way at Lad&acirc;kh itself, or, as
the people call it, Leh. We remained a week, and saw
all the "foreigners" who came there to sell furs and silk.
It is called the "Great Emporium" of trade between
Yarkund and Kashgar and Llassa, and Hindostan. Fine
words look well on paper, but to my unsophisticated mind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
the "leading merchants" seemed <i>peddlers</i>, and the "Emporium"
to be a brace of hucksters' shops. However, 'tis
curious, that's a fact, to see (and talk to) a set of men
who have got their goods from the yellow-haired Russians
at the Nishni-Novogorod fair, and brought them across
Asia to sell at Lad&acirc;kh. It is forty days' journey, of almost
a continuous desert, for these caravans from Yarkund
to Leh; and there is no small danger to life and limb by
the way. The current coin is lumps of Chinese sycee
silver of two pounds' weight each. I bought a Persian
horse for the journey, and paid for it in solid silver four
pounds weight: 166 rupees, or about 16<i>l.</i> I shall sell it
for double the money when the journey is over. Leh is
a small town, of not more than 400 houses, on a projecting
promontory of rock stretching out into the valley
formed by one of the small feeders of the Indus. For
the people, they are Bodhs, and wear tails, and have flat
features like the Chinese, and black garments. The
women, unlike other Asiatics whom I have seen, go about
the streets openly, as in civilized countries; but they are
an ugly race, and withal dirty to an absolutely unparalleled
extent. They wear no head-dress, but plait their
masses of black hair into sundry tails half way down
their backs. Covering the division of the hair from the
forehead back and down the shoulders, is a narrow
leathern strap, universally adorned with rough turquoises
and bits of gold or silver. The old Ranee whom we
called upon had on this strap (in her case a broader one,
about three fingers wide) 156 large turquoises, worth
some hundreds of pounds. Over their ears they wear
flaps of fur which project forward with precisely the
effect of blinkers on a horse.</p>

<p>The climate is delightful; it never rains; the sky is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
blue to a fault, and snow only falls sparingly in winter,
though the climate is cold, being 10,000 feet (they say)
above the sea. In boiling water the thermometer was
only 188&deg;. I never felt a more exhilarating air. That
one week quite set me up, and I have been better ever
since. The Llamas or monks, with their red cardinal's
hats and crimson robes, look very imposing and monastic,
quite a travesty of the regular clergy, and they blow just
such trumpets as Fame does on monuments in country
churches. Jolly friars they are, and fat to a man. From
Leh we crossed the mountain ridge which separates the
two streams of the Indus, and descended the northern (or
right) stream to this place, the capital of Bultistan or
Little Thibet. It is a genuine humbug. In the middle
of a fine valley, some 6,000 feet above the sea, surrounded
by sudden rising perpendicular mountains 6,000 feet
higher, stands an isolated rock washed by the Indus,
some two miles by three quarters: a little Gibraltar.
The valley may be ten miles by three, partially cultivated,
and inhabited by some 200 scattered houses.
There's Iskardo. There <i>was</i> a fort on the rock, but that
is gone, and all, as usual in the East, bespeaks havoc;
only nature is grand here. The people are Mussulmans,
and not Bodhs, and are more human-looking, but not so
well clad. It is warmer by far, much more so than it
ought to be. The thermometer was at 92&deg; in our tents
to-day, a thing for which I cannot possibly account, since
there is snow now on all sides of us. We go hence
across the Steppe of Deo Sole towards Cashmere for four
days' journey, and then strike westward to cross the Indus
into Gilghit, whence we return to Cashmere by the
end of September. We have been making very fast
marches, varying from sixteen to thirty-two miles a day,&mdash;hard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
work in a country with such roads, and where
you must take things with you. I enjoy it very much,
however, and after a year's sickness, the feeling of returning
health is refreshing. I shall return to work again by
the 1st of December; but I propose paying a flying visit
to Mr. Thomason in October, if possible; but the distances
are so vast, and the means of locomotion so absent,
that these things are difficult to achieve. I suppose I
have seen more of the hill country now than ninety-nine
men out of a hundred in India. Indeed, not above four
Europeans have been here before. But travelling suits
my restless spirit. Sir Henry and I get on famously
together.

<p>On October 7th, 1850, he writes from Simla to

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I have had a long and fatiguing march from Cashmere
across the mountains and the valleys of the "five rivers,"
nearly four hundred miles, which I accomplished in fifteen
days. I left Sir Henry Lawrence in Cashmere. I have
since heard from him, urging me to use all the influence I
can muster up here to procure a brevet majority in <i>posse</i>
(<i>i.e.</i> on attaining my regimental captaincy), and a <i>local</i>
majority in <i>esse</i> for "my services in the late war;" and
adding, that if I did not find civil employment to suit me,
he would, when I had given it a fair trial, try and get me
the command of one of the regiments in the Punjaub. I
am going to consult Mr. Thomason on the subject, and
will let you know the result. I hate the least suspicion
of toadyism, and dislike asking favors, or I should have
been better off ere now; but on Sir Henry Lawrence's
suggestion, I will certainly use any opportunity which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
may offer. I thought, however, you would be gratified
with the opinion which must have dictated so perfectly
spontaneous an offer. I confess that I very much prefer
the military line myself, although I like civil work much,
and it is the road to competence. Nevertheless, military
rank and distinctions have more charm for me than
rupees; and I would rather <i>cut</i> my way to a name and
poverty with the sword, than <i>write</i> it to wealth with the
pen.</p>

<p>There is something to me peculiarly interesting in the
<i>forming</i> and <i>training</i> soldiers, and in acquiring that extraordinary
influence over their minds, both by personal
volition and the aid of discipline, which leads them on
through danger, even to death, at your bidding. I felt
the enthusiasm of this power successfully exerted with
the Guides during the late war; and having felt it, am
naturally inclined to take advantage of it on future occasions.

<p>It is rather too late to tell you "all about Cashmere,"
as you desire; but I <i>can</i> say that I saw some beauties
this time who were really so to no common extent; and
that I was much more pleased with the valley than on
my first visit, which was a winter one. If you see what
wonderfully out-of-the-way places we got into, I think
you will marvel that I managed to write at all. We
traversed upwards of fifteen hundred miles of wild mountainous
countries, innocent of roads, and often, for days
together, of inhabitants, and carrying our houses on our
backs. The change to the utter comfort and civilization
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
of this house was something "stunning;" and I have not
yet become quite reconciled to dressing three times a day,
black hat, and patent leather boots. I need hardly say,
however, that I have very much enjoyed my visit and my
"big talks" with Mr. Thomason. He is very gray, and
looks older than when I saw him in 1847, but otherwise
he is just the same, working magnificently, and doing
wonders for his province. Already the Northwest Provinces
are a century in advance of the Bengal Proper
ones. As a Governor he has not his equal; and in honesty,
high-mindedness, and indefatigable devotion to the
public good, he is <i>facile princeps</i> of the whole Indian service.
Nor is there a household in India to match his,
indeed, it is about the only "big-wig" house to which
people go with pleasure rather than as a duty. I saw
Sir Charles Napier, too, and dined with him last week.
He is very kind and pleasant, and I am very sorry on
public grounds that he is going away.

<p>I had a most pleasant home-like visit to Mr. Thomason,
and was most affectionately entertained. He will have
told you of the power of civility I met with at Simla from
the "big-wigs," and that even Lord Dalhousie waxed
complimentary, and said that "Lumsden and Hodson
were about the best men he had," (that I write it that
shouldn't!) and that he promised to do his best to get me
a brevet majority as soon as I became, in the course of
time, a regimental captain. And Sir Charles Napier
(the best abused man of his day) was anxious to get for
me the Staff appointment of Brigade-Major to the Punjaub
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
Irregular Force,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, of the six newly raised cavalry
and infantry regiments for frontier service. He did
not succeed, for the berth had been previously filled up
unknown to him; but he <i>tried to do</i> so, and that's a compliment
from such a man. I hope I need not say that
this good deed of his was as spontaneous as a mushroom's

<p>I am to be here next year, I find, by tidings just received,
which will be a splendid thing for my constitution.
My connection with Umritsur is dissolved by my having
been appointed to act as personal assistant to the Commissioner
of the Cis-Sutlej States, which is, I believe, a
piece of promotion. The great advantages are, first, the
capital opportunity it affords of experience in every kind
of civil work, and of being under a very able man,&mdash;Mr.
Edmonstone; and secondly, that the Commissioner's
head-quarters are "peripatetic" in the cold weather,
and in the hills during the remainder of the year. But
I confess that I hanker after the "Guides" as much as
ever, and would catch at a good opportunity of returning to
them with honor. I fear I have been remiss in explanations
on this subject. The matter lies in this wise,&mdash;I
left the Corps and took to civil employment at the advice
of Sir Henry Lawrence, Mr. Thomason, and others,
though against my own feelings on the subject. The
man or men who succeeded me are senior to me in army
rank. When one of them resigned six months ago, I
was strongly disposed and urged to try and succeed to
the vacancy. There was a hitch, however, from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
cause I have mentioned, and Lumsden was anxious that
his lieutenants should not be disgusted by supersession.
I might have had the appointment, but withdrew to avoid
annoying Lumsden. <i>Now</i>, both Sir Henry Lawrence
and Mr. Thomason are very sorry that I ever left the
Corps, and that they advised the step. Things have
taken a different turn since then, and it is confessedly the
best thing a young soldier can aspire to. I know that my
present line is one which leads to more pecuniary advantages;
but the other is the finer field, and is far more
independent. I shall work away, however, cheerfully in
the civil line until I see a good opening in the other; and
<i>then</i>, I fear you will hardly persuade me that sitting at a
desk with the thermometer at 98&deg; is better than soldiering,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
than <i>commanding</i> soldiers made and taught by
yourself! I will give you the earliest warning of the
change.

<p>I broke down again most completely as soon as the
hot weather began, but my flight to this beautiful climate
has wonderfully refreshed me. Talk of Indian luxuries!
There are but two, cold water and cool air! I get on
very comfortably with my new "Chief." He is a first-rate
man, and has a most uncommon appetite for work, of
which there is plenty for both of us. We cover a good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
stretch of country&mdash;comprising five British districts and
nine sovereign states; and as the whole has been in
grievous disorder for many years, and a peculiarly difficult
population to deal with, you may imagine that the
work is not slight. My principal duty is hearing appeals
from orders and decisions by the district officers in these
five districts. It is of course not "per se," but as the
Commissioner's personal assistant, that I do this. I prepare
a short abstract, with my opinion on each case, and
he issues his orders accordingly. I was at work a whole
day lately over one case, which, after all, involved only a
claim to about a quarter of an acre of land! You will
give me credit for ingenuity in discovering that the result
of some half dozen quires of written evidence was to
prove that <i>neither</i> of the contending parties had any right
at all! If that's not "justice to Ireland," I don't know
what is! I have been staying with Captain Douglas, and
I hope I shall see a great deal of him. There is not a
better man or more genuine soldier going. This may
appear faint praise, but rightly understood, and conscientiously
and boldly worked out, I doubt whether any other
profession calls forth the higher qualities of our nature
more strongly than does that of a soldier in times of
war and tumults. Certain it is that it requires the highest
order of man to be a good general, and in the lower
ranks, (in this country especially,) even with all the
frightful drawbacks and evils, I doubt whether the
Saxon race is ever so pre&euml;minent, or its good points
so strongly developed, as in the "European" soldier
serving in India, or on service anywhere.

very summit of the mountain ridge, from which a most
splendid view is obtainable for six months in the year.
In the immediate foreground rises a round-backed ridge,
on which stands the former work of my hands, the "Lawrence

far off in the interminable south, the wide glistening
plains of the Punjaub, streaked with the faint ribbon-like
lines of the Sutlej and its tributaries, and the wider sea-like
expanse of Hindostan, stretch away in unbroken
evenness beyond the limits of vision, and almost beyond
those of faith and imagination. On the other side you
look over a mass of mountains up to the topmost peaks
of Himalaya. So narrow is the ridge, that it seems as
though you could toss a pebble from one window into the
Sutlej, and from the other into the valley below Simla. I
like the place very much. I have seven or eight hours'
work every day, and the rest is spent (as this one) in the

the unanimity of my official superiors in pressing the
point upon him, Mr. Edmonstone having commenced attacking
him in my favor before I had been under him
four months. I am not in love with the kind of employment,&mdash;I
long with no common earnestness for the more
military duties of my old friends the "Guides;" but I
am not therefore insensible to the advantages of doing
well in this line of work. Ambition alone would dictate
this, for my success in this civil business (which is considered
the highest and most arduous branch of the public
service) almost insures my getting on in any other
hereafter.

<p>I fancy the change is as great in myself as in either.
The old visions of boyhood have given place to the vehement
aspirations of a military career and the interests of
a larger ambition. I thirst now not for the calm pleasures
of a country life, the charms of society, or a career of
ease and comfort, but for the maddening excitement of
war, the keen contest of wits involved in dealing with
wilder men, and the exercise of power over the many by
force of the will of the individual. Nor am I, I hope,
insensible to the vast field for good and for usefulness
which these vast provinces offer to our energies, and to
the high importance of the trust committed to our charge.

<p>I am much stronger now, and improving rapidly. By
the end of next summer I hope to be as strong as I ever
hope to be again. That I shall ever again be able to
row from Cambridge to Ely in two hours and ten minutes,
to run a mile in five minutes, or to walk from Skye
(or Kyle Hatren Ferry) to Inverness in thirty hours, is
not to be expected, or perhaps desired. But I have
every hope that in the event of another war I may be
able to endure fatigue and exposure as freely as in 1848.
One is oftener called upon to ride than to walk long distances
in India. In 1848, I could ride one hundred
miles in ten hours, fully accoutred, and I don't care how
soon (saving your presence!) the necessity arises again!
I have no doubt that matrimony will do me a power of
good, and that I shall be not only better, but happier and
more care-less than hitherto.</p>

<p>I have been deeply grieved and affected by the death,
two days ago, of Colonel Bradshaw, of the 60th Rifles.
He will be a sad loss, not only to his regiment, but to the
army and the country. He was the <i>beau ideal</i> of an
English soldier and gentleman, and would have earned
himself a name as a General had he been spared. A
finer and nobler spirit there was not in the army. I feel
it as a deep personal loss, for he won my esteem and regard
in no common degree.

<p class="ch_summ">
MARRIAGE.&mdash;COMMAND OF THE GUIDES.&mdash;FRONTIER
WARFARE.&mdash;MURD&Acirc;N.</p>

<p>On the 5th of January, 1852, Lieut. Hodson
was married, at the Cathedral, Calcutta, to Susan,
daughter of Capt. C. Henry, R. N., and
widow of John Mitford, Esq., of Exbury, Hants.
By the first week in March he had resumed his
duties at Kussowlee as Assistant Commissioner.
On the breaking out of the war with Burmah he
expected to rejoin his regiment, (the First Bengal
European Fusileers,) which had been ordered for
service there, but in August he writes from Kussowlee:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
My regiment is on its way down the Ganges to Calcutta,
to take part in the war, but the Burmese have
proved so very unformidable an enemy this time, that
only half the intended force is to be sent on from Calcutta;
the rest being held in reserve. Under these
circumstances, and in the expectation that the war will
very speedily be brought to a close, the Governor-General
has determined not to allow officers on civil employment
to join their regiments in the usual manner. I
am thus spared what would have been a very fatiguing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
and expensive trip, with very little hope of seeing any
fighting.
</p>
</div>

<p>It was not long, however, before an opportunity
of seeing active service presented itself, and
in a way, of all others, most to his taste. His
heart had all along been with his old corps, "the
Guides," as his letters show. He had taken an
active share in raising and training them originally,
and, as second in command during the
Punjaub campaign of 1848-9, had contributed in
no small degree to gain for the Corps that reputation
which it has recently so nobly sustained
before Delhi.</p>

<p>The command was now vacant, and was offered
to him; but I must let him speak for himself:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left55">
<span class="smcap">Kussowlee</span>, <i>Sept. 23d, 1852</i>.
</p>

<p>Lumsden, my old Commandant in the Guides, goes
to England next month, and the Governor-General has
given me the command which I have coveted so long.
It is immense good fortune in every way, both as regards
income and distinction. It is accounted the most honorable
and arduous command on the frontier, and fills the
public eye, as the papers say, more than any other.</p>

<p>This at the end of seven years' service is a great
thing, especially on such a frontier as Peshawur, at the
mouth of the Kyber Pass. You will agree with me in
rejoicing at the opportunities for distinction thus offered
to me.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomason writes thus: "I congratulate you very
sincerely on the fine prospect that is open to you, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
trust that you will have many opportunities of showing
what the Guides can do under your leadership. I have
never ceased to reproach myself for advising you to leave
the Corps, but now that you have the command, you will
be all the better for the dose of civilianism that has been
intermediately administered to you."

<span class="smcap">Kussowlee</span>, <i>Oct. 7th, 1852</i>.
</p>

<p>Here I am, still, but hoping to take wing for Peshawur
in a few days. It is only 500 miles; and, as there are
no railways, and only nominal roads, and five vast rivers
to cross, you may suppose that the journey is not one of
a few hours' lounge.</p>

<p>I am most gratified by the appointment to the command
of the Guides, and more so by the way in which it was
given me, and the manner of my selection from amidst a
crowd of aspirants. It is no small thing for a subaltern
to be raised to the command of a battalion of infantry
and a squadron and a half of cavalry, with four English
officers under him! I am supposed to be the luckiest
man of my time. I have already had an offer from the
Military Secretary to the Board of Administration to
exchange appointments with him, although I should gain,
and he would lose 200<i>l.</i> a year by the "swop;" but
I would not listen to him; I prefer the saddle to the
desk, the frontier to a respectable, wheel-going, dinner-giving,
dressy life at the capital; and&mdash;ambition to
money!
</p>
</div>

<p>But though his "instincts were so entirely military,"
(to use his own words,) this did not prevent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
his discharging his civil duties in a manner
that called forth the highest eulogium from his
superiors, as the subjoined letter from Mr. Edmonstone,
now Secretary to Government at Calcutta,
will testify:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Hodson</span>,&mdash;I am a bad hand at talking,
and could not say what I wished, but I would not have
you go away without thanking you heartily for the support
and assistance which you have always given me in
all matters, whether big or little, since you joined me,
now twenty months and more ago. I have in my civil
and criminal reports for the past year recorded my sense
of your services, and your official merits, but our connection
has been peculiar, and your position has been one
which few would have filled either so efficiently or so
agreeably to all parties. You have afforded me the
greatest aid in the most irksome part of my duty, and
have always with the utmost readiness undertaken anything,
no matter what, that I asked you to dispose of, and
I owe you more on this account than a mere official acknowledgment
can repay adequately. I hope that though
your present appointment will give you more congenial
duties and better pay, you will never have occasion to
look back to the time you have passed here with regret;
and I hope too that all your anticipations of pleasure and
pride, in commanding the Corps which you had a chief
hand in forming, may be realized.</p>

<span class="smcap">Camp in Huz&aacute;ra</span>, <i>Dec. 16th, 1852</i>.
</p>

<p>I took command of the Guides on the 1st November,
and twenty-four hours afterwards marched "on service"
to this country, which is on the eastern or left bank of
the Indus, above the parallel of Attok. We are now in
an elevated valley, surrounded by snowy mountains, and
mighty cold it is, too, at night. We have come about 125
miles from Peshawur, and having marched up the hill,
are patiently expecting the order to march down again.
We have everything necessary for a pretty little mountain
campaign but an enemy. This is usually a <i>sine qu&acirc;
non</i> in warfare, but not so now. Then we have to take
a fort, only it has ceased to exist months ago; and to
reinstate an Indian ally in territories from which he was
expelled by some neighbors, only he wont be reinstated
at any price.</p>

<p>My regiment consists of five English officers, including
a surgeon, Dr. Lyell, a very clever man. Then I have
300 horse, including native officers, and 550 foot, or 850
men in all, divided into three troops and six companies,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
the latter armed as riflemen. My power is somewhat
despotic, as I have authority to enlist or dismiss from the
service, flog or imprison, degrade or promote any one,
from the native officers downwards, always remembering
that an abuse of power might lose me the whole. This
sort of chiefdom is necessary with a wild sort of gentry
of various races and speeches, gathered from the snows
of the Hindoo Koosh and the Himalaya, to the plains of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
Scinde and Hindostan, all of whom are more quick at
blows than at words, and more careless of human life
than you could possibly understand in England by any
description. I am likely to have civil charge as well as
military command of the Euzofzai district, comprising
that portion of the great Peshawur valley which lies between
the Cabul River and the Indus. So you see I am
not likely to eat the bread of idleness at least. I will
tell you more of my peculiar duties when I have more
experience of their scope and bent.... I am, I should
say, the most fortunate man in the service, considering
my standing. The other candidates were all field-officers
of some standing.</p>

<p>Our good friend and guest, Captain Powys, of the
60th, who has spent the first six months of our married
life under our roof, is on the way to England. He will
see you very soon, and give you a better account of us
than you could hope for from any one else.
</p>
</div>

<p>Notwithstanding all appearance to the contrary
at its opening, the campaign lasted seven weeks,
and supplied plenty of fighting. It was afterwards
characterized by my brother as the hardest
piece of service he had yet seen. One engagement
lasted from sunrise to sunset. He had thus
an opportunity of displaying his usual gallantry
and coolness, and showing how well he could
handle his "Guides" in mountain warfare. They
suffered much from cold, as the ground was covered
with snow for a part of the time, and from
want of supplies.</p>

<p>Colonel (now Sir R.) Napier, speaking afterwards
of this expedition, said:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span></p>

<p>"Your brother's unfailing fun and spirits, which
seemed only raised by what we had to go through,
kept us all alive and merry, so that we looked
back upon it afterwards as a party of pleasure,
and thought we had never enjoyed anything
more."
</p>

<p>In reply to congratulations on his appointment,
my brother wrote from&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left55">
<span class="smcap">Peshawur</span>, <i>March 13th, 1853</i>.
</p>

<p>I have certainly been very fortunate indeed, and only
hope that I may be enabled to acquit myself of the trust
well and honorably, both in the field and in the more
political portion of my duties. It was a good thing that
I had the opportunity of leading the regiment into action
so soon after getting the command, and that the brunt of
the whole should have fallen upon us, as it placed the
older men and myself once more on our old footing of
confidence in one another, and introduced me to the
younger hands as their leader when they needed one.
Susie says she told you all about it; I need therefore
only add that it was the hardest piece of service, while it
lasted, I have yet seen with the Guides, both as regards
the actual fighting, the difficulties of the ground, (a rugged
mountain, 7,000 feet high, and densely wooded,) and the
exposure. You will see little or no mention of it publicly,
it being the policy of Government to make everything
appear as quiet as possible on this frontier, and to
blazon the war on the eastern side of the empire (some
2,000 miles away) as much as they can. I am, as you
justly imagined, to be employed both civilly and in a
military capacity,&mdash;at least, it is under discussion. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
was asked to take charge of the wild district of "Euzofzai,"
(forming a large portion of the Peshawur province,)
where the Guides will ordinarily be stationed. I refused
to do so unless I had the exclusive civil charge in all
departments, magisterial, financial, and judicial, instead
of in the former only, as proposed, and I fancy they will
give in to my reasons. I shall then be military chief,
and civil governor, too, as far as that part of the valley
is concerned, and shall have enough on my hands, as you
may suppose. In the mean time, I shall have the superintendence
of the building of a fort to contain us all,&mdash;not
such a fortress as Coblentz, or those on the Belgian
frontier, but a mud structure, which answers all the purposes
we require at a very, very small cost.

<p>... I hope to get away from work and heat in
August or September for a month, if all things remain
quiet. But for this sad separation, there would be much
charm for me in this gypsy life. To avoid the great heats
of the next three months in tents, we are building huts
for ourselves of thatch, and mine is assuming the dignity
of mud walls. We are encamped on a lovely spot, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
the banks of the swift and bright river, at the foot of the
hills, on the watch for incursions or forays, and to guard
the richly cultivated plain of the Peshawur valley from
depredations from the hills. We are ready, of course, to
boot and saddle at all hours; our rifles and carabines are
loaded, and our swords keen and bright; and woe to the
luckless chief who, trusting to his horses, descends upon
the plain too near our pickets! Meanwhile, I am civil
as well as military chief, and the natural taste of the
Euzofzai Path&aacute;ns for broken heads, murder, and violence,
as well as their litigiousness about their lands, keeps me
very hard at work from day to day. Perhaps the life
may be more suited to a careless bachelor, than to a
husband with such a wife as mine; but even still it has
its charms for an active mind and body. A daybreak
parade or inspection, a gallop across the plain to some
outpost, a plunge in the river, and then an early breakfast,
occupy your time until 9 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> Then come a couple
of corpses whose owners (late) had their heads broken
overnight, and consequent investigations and examinations;
next a batch of villagers to say their crops are
destroyed by a storm, and no rents forthcoming. Then
a scream of woe from a plundered farm on the frontier,
and next a grain-dealer, to say his camels have been carried
off to the hills. "Is not this a dainty dish to set
before&mdash;your brother." Then each of my nine hundred
men considers me bound to listen to any amount of stories
he may please to invent or remember of his own
private griefs and troubles; and last, not least, there are
four young gentlemen who have each his fancy, and who
often give more trouble in transacting business than
assistance in doing it. However, I have no right to
complain, for I am about, yes, quite, the most fortunate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>

myself the happiest also, with such a wife and such a

<p>I hear that the new system for India is to throw open
Addiscombe and Haileybury to public competition; that
this public competition will be fair and open, and free
from jobbery and patronage, I suppose no sane person
in the 19th century, acquainted with public morals and
public bodies, would believe for an instant. The change
may, however, facilitate admission into the service to
well-crammed boys. There are, I doubt not, many
clever and able men who would in a year put any boy
with tolerable abilities into a state of intellectual coma,
which would enable him to write out examination papers
by the dozen, and pass a triumphant examination in
paper-military affairs. I am not called upon to state how
much of it would avail in the hour of strife and danger.
India is, <i>par excellence</i>, the country for poor men who

<span class="smcap">Murree</span>, <i>Sept. 14th, 1853</i>.
</p>

<p>I am enjoying a little holiday from arms and cutchery
up in the cool here with Susie. Murree is not more than
140 miles from Peshawur. You say that you do not
know "what I mean by hills in my part of India." This
is owing to the badness of the maps. The fact is, that
the whole of the upper part of the country watered by
the five rivers is mountainous. The Himalaya extends
from the eastern frontiers of India to Affghanistan, where
it joins the "Hindoo Koosh," or Caucasus. If you draw
a line from Peshawur, through Rawul Pindee, to Simla
or Subathoo, or any place marked on the maps thereabouts,
you may assume that all to the north of that line
is mountain country. Another chain runs from Peshawur,
down the right bank of the Indus to the sea. At Attok
the mountains close in upon the river, or more correctly
speaking, the river emerges from the mountains, and the
higher ranges end there. The Peshawur valley is a wide
open plain, lying on the banks of the Cabul River, about
sixty miles long by forty broad, encircled by mountains,
some of them covered with snow for eight or nine months
of the year. Euzofzai is the northeastern portion of this
valley, embraced between the Cabul River and the Indus.
Half of Euzofzai (the "abode of the children of Joseph")
is mountain, but we only hold the level or plain part of it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
Nevertheless, a large part of my little province is very
hilly. In the northeast corner of Euzofzai, hanging
over the Indus, is a vast lump of a hill, called "Mahabun"
(or the "great forest"), thickly peopled on its slopes,
and giving shelter to some 12,000 armed men, the bitterest
bigots which even Islam can produce. The hill is
about 7,800 feet above the level of the sea. This has
been identified by the wise men with the Aornos of Arrian,
and Alexander is supposed to have crossed the Indus
at its foot. Whether he did so or not I am not "at liberty
to mention," but it is certain that Nadir Shah, in one
of his incursions into India, marched his host to the top
of it, and encamped there. This gives color to the story
that the Macedonian did the same. As in all ages, there
are dominating points which are seized on by men of
genius when engaged in the great game of war. The
great principles of war seem to change as little as the
natural features of the country. Well, you will see how
a mountain range running "slantingdicularly" across the
Upper Punjaub contains many nice mountain tops suited
to Anglo-Saxon adventurers. If you can find Rawul
Pindee on the maps, you may put your finger on Murree,
about twenty-five miles, as the crow flies, to the northeast.
You should get a map of the Punjaub, Cashmere,
and Iskardo, published by Arrowsmith in 1847. George
sent me two of them. They are the best published maps
I have seen. As to the Euzofzai fever, that is, I am
happy to say, now over. It was terrible while it lasted.
Between the 1st March and the 15th June, 1853, 8,352
persons died out of a population of 53,500. It was very
similar to typhus, but had some symptoms of yellow fever.
It was confined to natives. It appeared to be contagious
or infectious, but I am so entirely skeptical as to the existence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
of either contagion or infection in these Indian
complaints, that I cannot bring myself to believe that the
appearances were real.</p>

<p>Poor Colonel Mackison, the Commissioner at Peshawur,
(the chief civil and political officer for the frontier), was
stabbed, a few days ago, by a fanatic, while sitting in his
veranda reading. The fellow was from Sw&acirc;t, and said
he had heard that we were going to invade his country,
and that he would try to stop it, and go to heaven as a
martyr for the faith. Poor Mackison is still alive, but in
a very precarious state, I fear. I hope this may induce
Government to take strong measures with the hill-tribes.
</p>
</div>

<p>He had soon to mourn the loss of a still more
valued friend:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left65">
<i>Oct. 15th, 1853</i>.
</p>

<p>You will have been much shocked at hearing of poor
dear Mr. Thomason's death.</p>

<p>It is an irreparable loss to his family and friends, but
it will be even more felt in his public capacity. He had
not been ill, but died from sheer debility and exhaustion,
produced by overwork and application in the trying season
just over. Had he gone to the hills, all would have
been right. I cannot but think that he sacrificed himself
as an example to others. You may imagine how much I
have felt the loss of my earliest and best friend in India,
to whom I was accustomed to detail all my proceedings,
and whom I was wont to consult in every difficulty and
doubt.
</p>
</div>

<p>On the 2d November he wrote from Rawul Pindee
to announce the birth of a daughter. He had
been obliged previously to return to his duties;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
but, by riding hard all night, had been able to be
with his wife at the time, and, after greeting the
little stranger, had immediately to hasten back to
his Guides on the frontier.</p>

<p>The Government, with a view to secure the
Kohat Pass, were now preparing an expedition
against the refractory tribe of the Borees, one of
the bravest and wildest of the Affghan race, in
order to prove that their hills and valleys were
accessible to our troops.</p>

<p>Accordingly, a force consisting of 400 men of
her Majesty's 22d, 450 Goorkhas, 450 Guides,
and the mountain train, marched at 4 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> on the
morning of the 29th November, under the command
of Brigadier Boileau, to attack the villages
in the Boree valley.</p>

<p>I must supply the loss of my brothers own
account by a letter from an officer with the expedition:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"Our party, after crossing the hills between
Kundao and the main Affreedee range at two
points, reunited in the valley at 10.30 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>, and
with the villages of the Borees before us at the
foot of some precipitous crags. These it at once
became apparent must be carried before the villages
could be attacked and destroyed. The service
devolved on two detachments of the Goorkhas
and Guides, commanded by Lieutenants Hodson
and Turner, and the style in which these gallant
fellows did their work, and drove the enemy from
crag to rock and rock to crag, and finally kept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
them at bay from 11 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> to 3 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>, was the
admiration of the whole force. We could plainly
see the onslaught, especially a fierce struggle that
lasted a whole hour, for the possession of a breastwork,
which appeared inaccessible from below,
but was ultimately carried by the Guides, in the
face of the determined opposition of the Affreedees,
who fought for every inch of ground.</p>

<p>"Depend upon it, this crowning of the Boree
heights was one of the finest pieces of light infantry
performance on record. It was, moreover,
one which Avitabile, with 10,000 Sikhs, was unable
to accomplish. During these operations on
the hill, the villages were burnt, and it was only
the want of powder which prevented the succession
of towers which flanked them being blown
into the air. The object of the expedition having
been thus fully achieved, the skirmishers were
recalled at about three, and then the difficulties
of the detachment commenced; for, as is well
known, the Affghans are familiar with the art of
following, though they will rarely meet an enemy.
The withdrawal of the Guides and Goorkhas
from the heights was most exciting, and none but
the best officers and the best men could have
achieved this duty with such complete success.
Lieutenant Hodson's tactics were of the most
brilliant description, and the whole force having
been once more reunited in the plain, they marched
out of the valley by the Turoonee Pass, which,
though farthest from the British camp, was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
shortest to the outer plains. The force did not
return to camp till between ten and eleven at
night, having been out nearly eighteen hours,
many of the men without food, and almost all
without water, the small supply which had been
carried out having soon been exhausted, and none
being procurable at Boree.</p>

<p>"Not an officer of the detachment was touched,
and only eight men killed and twenty-four wounded.
When the force first entered the valley, there
were not more than 200 Borees in arms to resist;
but before they returned, the number had increased
to some 3,000,&mdash;tens and twenties pouring in all
the morning from all the villages and hamlets
within many miles, intelligence of the attack
being conveyed to them by the firing."
</p>

<p>My brother's services on this occasion were thus
acknowledged by the Brigadier commanding, Colonel
Boileau, her Majesty's 22d Regiment, in a
despatch dated Nov. 29th, 1853:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"To the admirable conduct of Lieutenant Hodson in
reconnoitring, in the skilful disposition of his men, and
the daring gallantry with which he led his fine Corps in
every advance, most of our success is due; for the safety
of the whole force while in the valley of the Tillah depended
on his holding his position, and I had justly every
confidence in his vigilance and valor.</p>

<span class="smcap">Camp, Murd&acirc;n, Euzofzai</span>, <i>Jan. 2d, 1854</i>.
</p>

<p>I have been sadly long in answering your last most
welcome letter, but I have been so terribly driven from
pillar to post, that I have always been unable to sit down
at the proper time. My long holiday with dear Susie,
and journeyings to and fro to see her at Murree, and
our short campaign against the Affreedees in November,
threw me into a sea of arrears which was terrible to contemplate,
and still worse to escape from. I am now
working all day and half the night, and cannot as yet
make much impression on them.</p>

<p>I wish you could see your little grand-daughter being
nursed by a rough-looking Affghan soldier or bearded
Sikh, and beginning life so early as a dweller in tents.
She was christened by Mr. Clarke, one of the Church
Missionaries who happened to be in Peshawur. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
chaplain, who ought to have been there, was amusing
himself somewhere, and we could not catch a spare parson
for a fortnight.</p>

<p>You evidently do not appreciate the state of things in
these provinces. There are but two churches in the
Punjaub; and there will be an electric telegraph to Peshawur
before a church is commenced there, though the
station has been one for four years. In the first season,
a large Roman Catholic Chapel was built there, and an
Italian priest from the Propaganda busy in his vocation.
I offered Mr. C. all the aid in my power, though I told
him candidly that I thought he had not much chance of
success here. A large sum has been raised at Peshawur
for the Mission, but unfortunately they have gone wild
with theories about the lost tribes and fulfilment of prophecies
respecting the Jews, which has given a somewhat
visionary character to their plans. Mr. C. wanted me to
think that these Euzofzai Path&agrave;ns were Ben-i-Israel, and
asked me whether I had heard them call themselves so;
and he was aghast when I said they were as likely to
talk of Ben d'Israeli. All I can say is, that if they be
"lost tribes," I only wish they would find out a home
somewhere else among their cousins, and give me less
trouble.... My second in command was stabbed in the
back by a fanatic the other day while on parade, and has
had a wonderful escape for his life.</p>

<p>You would so delight in your little grand-daughter.
She is a lovely good little darling; as happy as possible,
and wonderfully quick and intelligent for her months. I
would give worlds to be able to run home and see you,
and show you my child, but I fear much that, unless I
find a "nugget," it is vain to hope for so much pleasure
just now. Meantime, I have every blessing a man can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
hope for, and not the least is that of your fond and much
prized affection.
</p>
</div>

<p>A few months later, again apologizing for long
silence, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left65">
<i>May 1st.</i>
</p>

<p>In addition to the very onerous command of 876 wild
men and 300 wild horses, and the charge of the civil administration
of a district almost as lawless as Tipperary,
I have had to build, and superintend the building of, a
fort to give cover to the said men and horses, including
also within its walls three houses for English officers, a
police station, and a native collector's office. He who
builds in India builds not in the comfortable acceptation
of the term which obtains at home. He sends not for his
Barry or his Basevi; calls not for a design and specifications,
and then beholds his house, and pays his bill; but
he builds as Noah may have built the Ark.</p>

<p>Down to the minutest detail of carpentry, smithery,
and masonry, and of "muddery," too, for that matter, he
must know what he is about, and show others what to do,
or good-bye to his hopes for a house.</p>

<p>Altogether, I am often fourteen hours a day at hard
work, and obliged to listen for a still longer period.</p>

<p>Our poor little darling had a very severe attack of
fever the other day, but is now well again, and getting
strong. I never see her without wishing that she was in
her grandfather's arms. You would so delight in her
little baby tricks and ways. She is the very delight
of our lives, and we look forward with intense interest
to her beginning to talk and crawl about. Both she
and her dear mother will have to leave for the hills very
soon, I am sorry to say. We try to put off the evil day,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
but I dare not expose either of my treasures to the heat
of Euzofzai or Peshawur for the next three months....
The young lady already begins to show a singularity of
taste,&mdash;refusing to go to the arms of any native women,
and decidedly preferring the male population, some of
whom are distinguished by her special favor. Her own
orderly, save the mark, never tires of looking at her
"beautiful white fingers," nor she of twisting them into
his black beard,&mdash;an insult to an Oriental, which he
bears with an equanimity equal to his fondness for her.
The cunning fellows have begun to make use of her too,
and when they want anything, ask the favor in the name
of Lilli B&acirc;b&acirc; (they cannot manage "Olivia" at all).
They know the spell is potent.

<p>The following letters from his wife's pen give a
lively picture of "domestic" life in the wilderness,
and of the wilderness itself:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left65">
"<i>January, 1854.</i>
</p>

<p>"Picture to yourself an immense plain, flat as a billiard
table, but not as green, with here and there a dotting
of camel thorn about eighteen inches high, by way of
vegetation. This far as the eye can reach on the east,
west, and south of us, but on the north the lasting snows
of the mighty Himalaya glitter and sparkle like a rosy
diadem above the lower range, which is close to our
camp. What would you say to life in such a wilderness?
or how would you stare to see the officers sit down to
table with sword and pistol? The baby never goes for
an airing without a guard of armed horsemen; what a
sensation such a cortege would create in Hyde Park!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span></p>
</div>

<hr class="l15" />

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left65">
"<i>April 15th.</i></p>

<p>"You ask for some detail of our life out here, and the
history of one day will be a picture of every one, with
little variation.</p>

<p>"At the first bugle, soon after daylight, W. gets up
and goes to parade, and from thence to superintend the
proceedings at the fort.</p>

<p>"By nine o'clock we are both ready for breakfast,
after which W. disappears into his business tent, where
he receives regimental reports, examines recruits, whether
men or horses, superintends stores and equipments, hears
complaints, and settles disputes, &amp;c. &amp;c. The regimental
business first dispatched, then comes 'kutcherry,' or civil
court matters, receiving petitions, adjusting claims, with a
still longer &amp;c. You may have some small idea of the
amount of this work, when I tell you that during the
month of March he disposed of twenty-one serious criminal
cases, such as murder, and 'wounding with intent,'
and nearly 300 charges of felony, larceny, &amp;c. At two
o'clock he comes in for a look at his bairn, and a glass of
wine. Soon after five a cup of tea, and then we order
the horses, and in the saddle till nearly eight, when I go
with him again to the fort, the garden, and the roads,
diverging occasionally to fix the site of a new village, a
well, or a watercourse.</p>

<p>"You can understand something of the delight of galloping
over the almost boundless plain in the cool, fresh
air, (for the mornings and evenings are still lovely,) with
the ground now enamelled with sweet-scented flowers,
and the magnificent mountains nearest us assuming every
possible hue which light and shadow can bestow. On
our return to camp, W. hears more reports till dinner,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
which is sometimes shared by the other officers, or chance
guests.</p>

<p>"When we are alone, as soon as dinner is over, the
letters which have arrived in the evening are examined,
classified, and descanted on, sometimes answered; and I
receive my instructions for next day's work in copying
papers, answering letters, &amp;c. And now do you not
think that prayers and bed are the fitting and well-earned
ending to the labors of the day?</p>

<p>"When you remember, too, that, in building the fort,
roads, and bridges, W. has to make his bricks and burn
them, to search for his timber and fell it, you will not
deny that his hands are full enough; but in addition, he
has to search for workmen, and when brought here, to
procure them food and means of cooking it. Some are
Mussulmans and eat meat, which must be killed and
cooked by their own people. Some are Hindoos, who
only feed on grain and vegetables, but every single man
must have his own chula or fireplace, with an inclosure
for him and his utensils, and if by chance any foot but
his own overstep his little mud wall, he will neither eat
nor work till another sun has arisen. Then some smoke,
while others hold it in abhorrence; some only drink
water, others must have spirits; so that it is no easy matter
to arrange the conflicting wants of some 1,100 laborers.
I shall be very thankful when this Murd&acirc;n K&ocirc;te is finished,
for it will relieve my poor husband of half his
labor and anxiety.</p>

<p>"By way of variety, we have native sports on great
holidays,&mdash;such as throwing the spear at a mark, or
'Nazabaze,' which is, fixing a stake of twelve or eighteen
inches into the ground, which must be taken up on the
spear's point while passing it at full gallop, or putting an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
orange on the top of a bamboo a yard high, and cutting
it through with a sword at full speed. W. is very clever
at this, rarely failing, but the spears are too long for any
but a lithe native to wield without risking a broken arm.
The scene is most picturesque;&mdash;the flying horsemen in
their flowing many-colored garments, and the grouping of
the lookers-on, make me more than ever regret not having
a ready pencil-power to put them on paper.</p>

<p>"The weather has been particularly unfavorable to the
progress of the fort, so that we are still in our temporary
hut and tents. Of course we feel the heat much more, so
domiciled. W. is grievously overworked, still his health
is wonderfully good, and his spirits as wild as if he were
a boy again. He is never so well pleased as when he
has the baby in his arms."

grieve to say, we part for the next three months. I hope
to rejoin them for a month in September, and accompany
them back to our new home, for by that time I trust that
my fortified cantonment will be ready, and our house too.
This said fort has been a burden and a stumbling-block to
me for months, and added grievously to my work, as I am
sole architect. It is built regularly, but of earthworks
and mud, and as it covers an area of twelve acres, you
may believe that it has been no slight task to superintend
its construction. It is a sad necessity, and the curse of
Indian life, this repeatedly recurring separation, but anything
is better than to see the dear ones suffer. I am fortunately
very well, and as yet untouched by the unusual

</p>

<p>I was summoned from Euzofzai to these hills, on the
26th June, by the tidings of the dangerous illness of our
sweet baby. I found her in a sinking state, and though
she was spared to us for another fortnight of deep anxiety
and great wretchedness, there was, from the time I
arrived, scarcely a hope of her recovery. Slowly and
by imperceptible degrees her little life wasted away until,
early on the morning of the 10th, she breathed her soul
away, so gently that those watching her intently were
conscious of no change. The deep agony of this bereavement
I have no words to describe. We had watched
her growth, and prided ourselves on her development
with such absorbing interest and joy; and she had so won
our hearts by her extreme sweetness and most unusual
intelligence, that she had become the very centre and
light of our home life, and in losing her we seem to have
lost everything. Her poor mother is sadly bowed down
by this great grief, and has suffered terribly both in health
and spirits.</p>

<p>I have got permission to remain with her a few days,
but I must return to my duty before the end of the
month.</p>

<p>We had the best and kindest of medical advice, and
everything, I believe, which skill could do was tried, but
in vain. She was lent to us to be our joy and comfort
for a time, and was taken from us again, and the blank
she has left behind is great indeed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span></p>

<p>I dare not take Susie down with me, much as she
wishes it, at this season, and in her state of health. I
must therefore leave her here till October. It is very
sad work to part again under these circumstances, but in
this wretched country there is no help for us. Your
kind and affectionate expressions about our little darling,
and your keen appreciation of the "unfailing source of
comfort and refreshment she was to my wearied spirit,"
came to me just as I had ceased to hope for the precious
babe's life.</p>

<p>... It has been a very, very bitter blow to us. She
had wound her little being round our hearts to an extent
which we neither of us knew until we woke from the
brief dream of beauty, and found ourselves childless.

year past, and gaining strength daily, and I am as well as

has caused me so much labor and anxiety; and I assure
you, a most comfortable dwelling we find it. Our houses
(I mean the European officers') project from the general
front of the works at the angles of the bastions, and are
quite private, and away from the noisy soldiers; and we
have, for India, a very pretty view of the hills and plains
around us. Above all, the place seems a very healthy
one. To your eye, fresh from England, it would appear
desolate from its solitude and oppressive from the vastness
of the scale of scene. A wide plain, without a break or
a tree, thirty miles long, by fifteen to twenty miles wide,
forms our immediate foreground on one side, and an endless
mass of mountains on the other.</p>

sign of the effects of Russian intrigue which we have

Dost Mahomed Khan, of Cabul, who, under the pressure
from without, has been fain to seek for alliance and aid

<p class="ch_summ">
REVERSES.&mdash;UNJUST TREATMENT.&mdash;LOSS OF COMMAND.&mdash;RETURN
TO REGIMENTAL DUTIES.</p>

<p>Up to this time my brother's career in India
had been one of almost uninterrupted prosperity.
He had attained a position unprecedented for a
man of his standing in the service, and enjoyed
a reputation for daring, enterprise, and ability, only
equalled by the estimation in which he was held
by all who knew him, for high principle and sterling
worth. He was, as he described himself, the
most fortunate and the happiest man in India.
But now the tide of fortune turned.</p>

<p>A storm had for some time been gathering, the
indications of which he had either overlooked or
despised, till it burst with its full force upon him,
and seemed for the moment to carry all before it,
blasting his fair fame and sweeping away his fortunes.
Many circumstances had conspired to
bring about this result, some of which will only
be fully appreciated by those who are acquainted
with the internal politics of the Punjaub at that
period. His appointment to the command of the
Guides, over the heads of many of his seniors,
had from the first excited much jealousy and ill-will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
among the numerous aspirants to so distinguished
a post. In India, more than in any other
country, a man cannot be prosperous or fortunate
without making many enemies; and every ascent
above the level of your contemporaries secures so
many additional "good haters;" nor is there any
country where enmity is more unscrupulous in the
means to which it has recourse. This mattered
comparatively little to my brother, so long as Sir
Henry Lawrence, to whose firm and discriminating
friendship he owed his appointment, remained
in power. He, however, had been removed from
the Administration of the Punjaub, and those
who had effected his removal, and now reigned
supreme, were not likely to look with very favorable
eyes upon one who, like my brother, was
known as his <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> and confidant, and had not
perhaps been as guarded, as in prudence he ought
to have been, in the expressions of his opinion on
various transactions. More recently still, Colonel
Mackeson, the Resident at Peshawur, his immediate
superior, for whom he entertained the highest
regard and affection, which was, I believe,
reciprocated, had fallen a victim to the dagger of
the assassin. This had, if possible, a still more
injurious influence on my brother's position, as
the new Resident was, both on public and private
grounds, opposed to him, and made no secret of
his wish to get rid of him from the charge of the
frontier.</p>

<p>With a prospect of such support, my brother's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
enemies were not likely to be idle. He had been
warned more than once of their undermining operations;
but strong in conscious integrity, and
unwilling to suspect others of conduct which he
would have scorned himself, he "held straight
on" upon his usual course, till he found himself
overwhelmed by a mass of charges affecting his
conduct, both in his military and civil capacity.</p>

<p>All that malice could invent or ingenuity distort,
was brought forward to give importance to
the accusations laid against him. Every trifling
irregularity or error of judgment was so magnified,
that a mighty fabric was raised on a single
grain of truth; and the result was, that towards
the close of the year he was summoned before a
court of inquiry at Peshawur.</p>

<p>That which seemed principally to give color to
the charges against him was, that there was undeniably
confusion and irregularity in the regimental
accounts; but this confusion, far from
having originated with him, had been very materially
rectified. He had succeeded to the command
in October, 1852, and within twenty-four
hours started on a campaign which lasted between
seven and eight weeks, without any audit
of accounts between himself and his predecessor,
who had, immediately on making over the command,
left for England; so that he found a mass
of unexplained confusion, which he had been endeavoring,
during his period of command, gradually
to reduce to some order. This he had to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
certain extent accomplished when summoned unexpectedly
to undergo an investigation and meet
the gravest accusations.</p>

<p>I will, however, in preference to any statements
of my own, which might not unnaturally be suspected
of partiality, insert here, though it was
written at a later period, a letter, giving an account
of the whole affair, from one whose opinion
must carry the greatest weight with all who know
him, either personally or by reputation, Sir R.
Napier. It has somewhat of an official character,
as it was addressed to the colonel of the 1st
Bengal European Fusileers, when my brother
subsequently rejoined that regiment.</p>

<p>And I may here observe, with regard to anything
which I may now or hereafter say reflecting
on the conduct and motives of those concerned
in this attempt to ruin my brother's prospects,
that I should not have ventured to make these
remarks simply on his authority, unless I had had
them confirmed, and more than confirmed, by
men of the highest character, both civil and military,
who were cognizant of all the transactions,
and did not scruple to express their indignation
at what they characterized as a most cruel and
unjust persecution.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Col. Welchman</span>,&mdash;I have great pleasure
in meeting your request, to state in writing my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
opinion regarding my friend Lieutenant Hodson's case.
Having been on intimate terms of friendship with him
since 1846, I was quite unprepared for the reports to his
disadvantage which were circulated, and had no hesitation
in pronouncing my utter disbelief in, and repudiation
of them, as being at variance with everything I had ever
known of his character. On arriving at Peshawur in
March, 1855, I found that Lieutenant Hodson had been
undergoing a course of inquiry before a Special Military
Court, and on reading a copy of the proceedings, I perceived
at once that the whole case lay in the correctness
of his regimental accounts; that his being summoned
before a Court, after suspension from civil and military
duty, and after an open invitation (under regimental
authority) to all complainants in his regiment, was a
most unusual ordeal, such as no man could be subjected
to without the 'greatest disadvantage; and notwithstanding
this, the proceedings' did not contain a single substantial
case against him, provided he could establish the
validity of his regimental accounts; and that he could
do this I felt more than confident. The result of Major
Taylor's laborious and patient investigation of Lieutenant
Hodson's regimental accounts has fully justified, but has
not at all added to, the confidence that I have throughout
maintained in the honor and uprightness of his conduct.
It has, however, shown (what I believed, but had not the
same means of judging of) how much labor Lieutenant
Hodson bestowed in putting the affairs of his regiment
in order. Having seen a great deal of the manner in
which the Guide Corps has been employed, I can well
understand how difficult it has been to maintain anything
like regularity of office; and how impossible it may be
for those who remain quietly in stations with efficient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
establishments, to understand or make allowance for the
difficulties and irregularities entailed by rapid movements
on service, and want of proper office means in adjusting
accounts for which no organized system had been established.
The manner in which Lieutenant Hodson has
elucidated his accounts since he had access to the necessary
sources of information, appears to be highly creditable.
I have twice had the good fortune to have been
associated with him on military service, when his high
qualities commanded admiration. I heartily rejoice,
therefore, both as a friend and as a member of the service,
'at his vindication from most grievous and unjust
imputations.' And while I congratulate the regiment on
his return to it, I regret that one of the best swords
should be withdrawn from the frontier service.&mdash;I remain,
yours very sincerely,</p>

<p class="left65">
"<span class="smcap">R. Napier</span>."
</p>
</div>

<p>On the receipt of Major Reynell Taylor's report,
to which reference is here made, Mr. Montgomery,
(then one of the Commissioners for the
Punjaub, now the Chief Commissioner in Oude,)
one of the men who, under God, have saved India,
wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"To me the whole report seemed more satisfactory
than any one I had ever read; and considering
Major Taylor's high character, patience,
and discernment, and the lengthened period he
took to investigate every detail, most triumphant.
This I have expressed to all with whom I have
conversed on the subject."
</p>

<p>All this, however, is an anticipation of the due
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
order of events. I must go back again to the
Court of Inquiry, in order to show more clearly
the injustice to which Lieutenant Hodson was
exposed. The proceedings of the Court terminated
on the 15th January, 1855. Till they were
submitted to the Governor-General, no decision
could be given, nor any report published, though
every publicity had been given to the accusations
made. Up to the last week in July, the papers
had not been forwarded from Lahore to be laid
before him. Meanwhile, not merely had my
brother been suspended from civil and military
duty during the inquiry, but without waiting for
the result, he had been superseded in his command,
on the ground that his continuing in Euzofzai,
where his corps was stationed, was inconsistent
with the public interest. This will appear
scarcely credible, but worse remains behind.</p>

<p>Ten months after the conclusion of the inquiry,
in consequence of repeated applications from my
brother for a minute investigation of his accounts,
Major Taylor, as has been mentioned, was appointed
to examine them, and on the 13th February,
1856, made his report. The document itself
is too long and technical for publication, but the
written opinions I have already quoted, of Sir R.
Napier and Mr. Montgomery, are sufficient to
show that it completely established Lieutenant
Hodson's innocence, and cleared him from the
grievous and unjust imputations cast upon him.
Yet in March, 1857, he discovered that this report
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
had never been communicated to the Commander-in-Chief,
or Secretary to Government. It had
been quietly laid aside in some office, and no
more notice taken. Lord Dalhousie left India,
having heard all that could be said against him,
and nothing in his vindication. I might give
many other details illustrative of the manner in
which, even in the nineteenth century, official enmity
can succeed in crushing one who is so unfortunate
as to be its victim, and of the small
chance which exists of redress, but I will not
weary my readers with them.</p>

<p>I give a few extracts from my brother's letters
at different times in the course of these proceedings,
to show the spirit in which he bore this
trial, bitter though it was, peculiarly grievous to
one of his sensitive feelings on all points of
honor.</p>

<p>In August, 1855, he wrote to me:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
They have not been able, with all their efforts, to fix
anything whatever upon me; all their allegations (and
they were wide enough in their range) have fallen to the
ground; and the more serious ones have been utterly disproved
by the mere production of documents and books.
The most vicious assertion was, that I had been so careless
of the public money passing through my hands, that
I had not only kept no proper accounts, but that paper
had never been inked on the subject, and consequently it
would be impossible to ascertain whether or not any deficiency
existed in my regimental treasure chest; and this
after I had laid my books on the table of the Court, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
begged that they might be examined, and after I had
subsequently officially applied for their examination by
proper accountants. Well, after seven months' delay, I
was offered the opportunity of producing them; and thus
I have now at last a chance of bringing out the real state
of the case. Up to the present time, the most critical and
hostile examination, lasting a month, has only served to
prove my earliest assertion, and my only one, that I could
give an ample account of every farthing of money intrusted
to me, whenever it might please the powers that
be to inquire into it. The sum total of money represented
by my account amounts to about 120,000<i>l.</i>, passing
through my hands in small fractional sums of receipt
and expenditure.</p>

<p>Not only do they find that I have regular connected
accounts of everything, but that these are supported by
vouchers and receipts. It has been a severe trial, and
the prolonged anxiety and distress of the past nine months
have been nearly insupportable.</p>

<p>I almost despair of making you, or any one not on the
spot, understand the ins and outs of the whole affair; and
I can only trust to the result, and to the eventual production
of all the papers, to put things in their proper light.
In the mean time I must endeavor to face the wrong, the
grievous, foul wrong, with a constant and unshaken heart,
and to endure humiliation and disgrace with as much
equanimity as I may, and with the same soldierlike
fortitude with which I ought to face danger, suffering,
and death in the path of duty.

<p>Your two sad letters came close upon one another, but
I could not write then. The blow<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> was overwhelming;
coming, too, at a time of unprecedented suffering and
trial, it was hard to bear up against. What a year this
has been! What ages of trial and of sorrow seem to
have been crowded into a few short months. Our darling
babe was taken from us on the day my public misfortunes
began, and death has robbed us of our father
before their end. The brain-pressure was almost too
much for me, coming as the tidings did at a time of peculiar
distress.... The whole, indeed, is so peculiarly
sad that one's heart seems chilled and dulled by the very
horror of the calamity.... I look with deep anxiety
for your next letters, but the mail seems exclusively
occupied with Sebastopol, and to have left letters behind.
</p>
</div>

<p>Again, to his sister, some months later:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I trust fondly that better days are coming; but really
the weary watching and waiting for a gleam of daylight
through the clouds, and never to see it, is more harassing
and harder to bear up against than I could have supposed
possible. I have been tried to the utmost, I do think. A
greater weight of public and private calamity and sorrow
surely never fell at once on any individual. But it has
to be borne, and I try to face it manfully and patiently,
and to believe that it is for some good and wise end.</p>

<p>By the way, I was much gratified and surprised at seeing,
in an article in the <i>Calcutta Review</i> written and
signed by Sir Henry Lawrence, a most flattering testimony<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
to my military character. Coming at such a time
it is doubly valuable.
</p>
</div>

<p>In another letter, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
It is pleasant indeed to find that not a man who knows
me has any belief that there has been anything wrong.
They think I have been politically wrong in not consulting
my own interests by propitiating the powers that be,
and they know that I am the victim of official enmity in
high places; but I am proud to say, that not one of them
all (and indeed I believe I might include my worst foes
and accusers in the category) believes that I have committed
any more than errors of judgment, and that, owing
to the pressure of work which came upon me all at once,
and which was more than one man could manage at once,
without leaving something to be done at a more convenient
season.</p>

<p>I can honestly say, that for months before I was summoned
into Peshawur for the inquiry, I had never known
what a half hour's respite from toil and anxiety was; in
fact, ever since I first traced the lines of the fort at Murd&acirc;n,
in December, 1853, I was literally weighed down
by incessant calls on my time and attention, and went to
bed at night thoroughly exhausted and worn out, to rise
before daylight to a renewed round of toil and worry.</p>

<p>I remember telling John Lawrence, that, if they got rid
of me, he would require three men to do the work which
I had been doing for Government; and it has already
proved literally true. They have had to appoint three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
different officers to the work I had done single-handed,
and that, too, after the worst was over!

<p>Of myself I have little to tell you; things have been
much in <i>statu quo</i>. Major Taylor's report, of which I
am going to send you a copy, is most satisfactory. There
is much which you will probably not understand in the
way of technicalities, but the general purport will be clear
to you.</p>

<p>I expect to join my regiment in about three weeks.
They are marching up from Bengal to Dugshai, a hill
station sixty miles from hence, and ten from Kussowlee
and Subathoo respectively, so I shall be close to old
haunts. I am very glad we shall be in a good climate,
for though I have not given in or failed, I am thankful
to say, still the last eighteen months have told a good
deal upon me, and I am not up to heat or work. If the
colonel (Welchman) can, he is going to give me the adjutancy
of the regiment, which will be a gain in every
way, not only as showing to the world that, in spite of all
which has happened, there is nothing against my character,
but as increasing my income, and giving me the opportunity
of learning a good deal of work which will be
useful to me, and of doing, I hope, a good deal of good
amongst the men. It will be the first step up the ladder
again, after tumbling to the bottom.
</p>
</div>

<p>Soon afterwards, Lieutenant Hodson rejoined
the 1st Fusileers at Dugshai. It may be necessary
for the sake of unprofessional readers, to explain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
that during the whole time that he had been
Assistant Commissioner in the Punjaub, or in
command of the Guides, he had continued to belong
to this regiment, as political or staff appointments
in India do not dissolve an officer's connection
with his own regiment.</p>

<p>On April 8th he writes from Dugshai:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
... I have but little to tell you to cheer you on
my account. My health, which had stood the trial wonderfully,
was beginning to fail, but I shall soon be strong
again in this healthy mountain air 7,000 feet above the
sea.</p>

<p>This is a great thing, but it is very hard to begin again
as a regimental subaltern after nearly eleven years' hard
work. However, I am very fond of the profession, and
there is much to be done, and much learnt, and, under
any other circumstances, I should not regret being with
English soldiers again for a time. Every one believes
that I shall soon be righted, but the "soon" is a long
time coming. I was much gratified the other day by an
unexpected visit from Mr. Charles Raikes, one of the
Punjaub Commissioners, who was passing through Umb&acirc;la,
on his way to take a high appointment at Agra. I
had no personal knowledge of him, but he came out of
his way to call upon me, and express his sympathy and
his appreciation of (what he was pleased to call) my high
character.</p>

<p>He said much that was encouraging and pleasing, which
I need not repeat. It served pleasantly, however, to show
that the tide was turning, and that in good men's minds
my character stood as high as ever.
</p>
</div>

<p>In addition to his other troubles, my brother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
was suffering all this time from a dislocated ankle.
He says in June:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I have nothing to tell you of myself, save that I have
to-day, for the first time for eight weeks, put my foot to
the ground; I cannot, however, yet walk a yard without
crutches.

an enemy in the field, and to do my appointed work resolutely
and to the best of my ability, satisfied that there is
a reason for all; and that even irksome duties well done
bring their own reward, and that if not, still they are
duties.</p>

<p>But it is sometimes hard to put up with the change!
I am getting a little stronger on my ankle, but am still
unable, at the end of five months, to do more than walk
about the house. Fancy my not being able to walk 200
yards for half a year.

allotted work as well and cheerfully as may be, satisfied

<p>I know nothing in my brother's whole career
more truly admirable, or showing more real heroism,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
than his conduct at this period while battling
with adverse fates.</p>

<p>Deeply as he felt the change in his position, he
accommodated himself to it in a manner that
won the admiration and esteem of all. Instead
of despising his regimental duties, irksome and
uninteresting, comparatively speaking, as they
were, he discharged them with a zeal and energy,
as well as cheerfulness, which called forth the following
strong expressions of commendation from
the colonel of his regiment. They are taken from
a letter addressed to the Adjutant-General of the
army:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left65">
"<span class="smcap">Umb&acirc;la</span>, <i>Jan. 18th, 1857</i>.

<p>... "I consider it a duty, and at the same time feel a
great pleasure, in requesting you to submit, for the consideration
of his Excellency the Commander-in-Chief,
this my public record and acknowledgment of the very
essential service Lieutenant Hodson has done the regiment
at my especial request. On the arrival of the regiment
at Dugshai, I asked Lieutenant Hodson to act as
quartermaster. I pointed out to him that, mainly owing
to a rapid succession of quartermasters when the regiment
was on field-service, the office had fallen into very
great disorder;... and that he would have to restore
order out of complicated disorder, and to organize a more
efficient working system for future guidance and observance.
To my great relief and satisfaction, Lieutenant
Hodson most cheerfully undertook the onerous duties;
he was suffering at the same time severe bodily pain,
consequent on a serious accident, yet this did not in any
way damp his energy, or prevent his most successfully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
carrying out the object in view.... It is impossible to do
otherwise than believe that this officer's numerous qualifications
are virtually lost to the State by his being employed
as a regimental subaltern, as he is fitted for, and
capable of doing great justice to, any staff situation; and
I am convinced, that should his Excellency receive with
approval this solicitation to confer on him some appointment
suited to the high ability, energy, and zeal which I
fear I have but imperfectly brought to notice, it would be
as highly advantageous to the service as gratifying to
myself. An officer whose superior mental acquirements
are fully acknowledged by all who know him; who has
ably performed the duties of a civil magistrate in a disturbed
district; whose knowledge of engineering has
been practically brought into play in the construction of a
fort on the Northwestern frontier; whose gallant conduct
in command of a regiment in many a smart engagement
has been so highly commended, and by such competent
authorities, is one whom I have confidence in recommending
for advancement; and in earnestly, yet most
respectfully, pressing the recommendation, I plead this
officer's high qualifications as my best apology....</p>

staff as well as those of a company; and, with a
diligence, method, and accuracy such as the best trained
regimental officers have never surpassed, succeeded, in a
manner fully justifying the high commendation bestowed
on him by his commanding officer. As a soldier in the
field, Lieutenant Hodson has gained the applause of
officers of the highest reputation, eye-witnesses of his

<p>Your letter written this day three months reached me
at Umb&acirc;la, at our mildest of "Chobhams" in the middle
of February, and deserved an earlier reply, but I have
been taken quite out of the private correspondence line
lately, by incessant calls on my time. Regimental work
in camp in India, with European regiments, no less than
in quarters, is contrived to cut up one's time into infinitesimal
quantities, and keep one waiting for every other
half hour through the day. I had more time for writing
when I commanded a frontier regiment, and governed a
province! These winter camps are very profitable, however,
and not by any means unpleasant; and as Umb&acirc;la
was very full, we had an unusual amount of society for
India, and some very pleasant meetings. I was too lame
to dance, but not to dine, and take part in charades or
tableaux, and so forth, and so contrived to keep alive
after the day's work was over. I got
some <span class="greek" title="kudos">&#954;&#8166;&#948;&#959;&#962;</span> and vast
kindness for performing the more strictly professional
r&ocirc;le of brigade-major to one of the infantry brigades,
and had excellent opportunities of learning the essential,
but so seldom taught or learned art, of man&oelig;uvring
bodies of troops. My service has been so much on the
frontier and with detached corps, that I had previously
had but small opportunities for the study. I had an
interview with General Anson the other day, and I hope
a satisfactory one. He is a very pleasant mannered and
gentlemanly man, open and frank in speech, and quick to
a proverb in apprehension, taking in the pith of a matter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
at a glance. As I always thought, it turned out that
Major Taylor's report had never reached the Commander-in-Chief,
and they had only the old one-sided
story to go upon. I explained the whole to him, and as
he had already very kindly read the papers relating to
the matter, he quite comprehended it, and begged me to
give him a copy of Taylor's report, when he would, if
satisfied, try and see justice done me. I trust, therefore,
that at last something will be done to clear me from all
stigma in the matter. As soon as that is done he will
give me some appointment or other, unless Government
do it themselves. Sir Henry Lawrence writes to me
most kindly, and is only waiting a favorable opportunity
to help me.</p>

<p>We are in a state of some anxiety, owing to the spread
of a very serious spirit of disaffection among the Sepoy
army. One regiment (the 19th of the line) has already
been disbanded, and, if all have their dues, more yet will
be so before long. It is our great danger in India, and
Lord Hardinge's prophecy, that our biggest fight in India
would be with our own army, seems not unlikely to be
realized, and that before long. Native papers, education,
and progress are against keeping 200,000 native mercenaries
in hand.

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left65">
<span class="smcap">Dugshai</span>, <i>May 5th, 1857</i>.
</p>

<p>Unless I hear of something to my advantage meanwhile,
I propose starting for Calcutta about the middle of
this merry month of May, with the object of endeavoring
to effect, by personal appeal and explanations, the self-vindication
which no mere paper warfare seems likely to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
extort from Government. I had waited patiently for
nearly two years, "striving to be quiet and do my own
business," in the hope that justice, however tardy, would
certainly overtake me, when an incident occurred which
showed that I must adopt a more active mode of procedure
if I wished for success. On applying for employment
with the force in Persia, I met with a refusal, on
the ground of what had occurred when in command of
the Guides. This, you will allow, was calculated to drive
a man to extremities who had been under the impression
all along that his conduct, whensoever and howsoever
called in question, had been amply vindicated.</p>

<p>It appeared that while everything to my disadvantage
had been carefully communicated by the Punjaub authorities
to army head-quarters, they had, with true liberality
and generosity, suppressed "in toto" the results of the
subsequent inquiry which had, in the opinion of all good
men, amply cleared my good name from the dirt lavished
on it. Even the Secretaries to Government had never
heard of this vindication, and were going on believing
all manner of things to my discredit; Lord Canning,
also, being utterly ignorant of the fact that, subsequently
to Lord Dalhousie's departure, the results of the second
investigation had been communicated to Government.</p>

<p>There were clearly three courses open to me, "&agrave; la
Sir Robert Peel."</p>

<p>1st. Suicide.</p>

<p>2d. To resign the service in disgust, and join the
enemy.</p>

<p>3d. To make the Governor-General eat his words, and
apologize.</p>

<p>I chose the last.</p>

<p>The first was too melodramatic and foreign; the second
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
would have been a triumph to my foes in the Punjaub;
besides, the enemy might have been beaten!</p>

<p>I have determined therefore, on a trip to Calcutta.</p>

<p>You will, I have no doubt, agree with me that I am
perfectly right in taking the field against the enemy, and
not allowing the Government to rest until I have carried
my point.
</p>
</div>

<p>In another letter of the same date:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I have had another interview with General Anson at
Simla, and nothing could have been more satisfactory.
He was most polite, even cordial, and while he approved
of my suggestion of going down to Calcutta to have personal
explanations with the people there, and evidently
thought it a plucky idea to undertake a journey of 2,500
miles in such weather (May and June), yet he said that
I had better wait till I heard again from him, for he
would write himself to Lord Canning, and try to get
justice done me.</p>

<p>I do trust the light is breaking through the darkness,
and that before long I may have good news to send you,
in which I am sure you will rejoice.
</p>
</div>

<p>It did break from a most unexpected quarter.</p>

<p>This was the last letter received in England
from my brother for some months. Six days
after it was written, the outbreak at Meerut occurred,
and almost immediately India was in a
blaze.</p>

<p>"Fortunate was it," my brother afterwards
said, "that I was delayed by General Anson till
he received an answer from Lord Canning, or I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
should undoubtedly have been murdered at some
station on the road. The answer never came. It
must have been between Calcutta and Allygurh
when disturbances broke out, and was, with all
the d&acirc;ks for many days, destroyed or plundered."</p>

<p>Most fortunate, too, was it, (if we may use
such an expression,) that in the hour of India's
extremity, Lieutenant Hodson was within reach
of the Commander-in-Chief, and available for
service. It was no longer a time to stand on
official etiquette. In that crisis, which tried the
bravest to the utmost, when a strong will and
cool head and brave heart were needed, he at
once rose again to his proper place in counsel
and in action.</p>

<p>But I must not anticipate what belongs to the
next chapter. One fact, however, I cannot refrain
from stating here, as an appropriate conclusion
of this narrative, that within six weeks of
the date of the last letter, Lieutenant Hodson
was actually commanding in the field, before the
walls of Delhi, by General Barnard's special request,
the very corps of Guides from which he
had been so unjustly ousted two years before.</p>

<p>"Was there ever," he says in reference to it, "a
stranger turn on the wheel of fortune? I have
much cause to be grateful, and I hope I shall not
forget the bitter lessons of adversity."</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<h2>NARRATIVE OF THE DELHI CAMPAIGN,
1857.</h2>

<hr class="l5" />

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="ch_summ">MARCH DOWN TO DELHI.</p>

<p>On the 10th May occurred the outbreak at
Meerut, closely followed by the massacre at
Delhi.</p>

<p>On the 13th, orders were received at Dugshai,
from the Commander-in-Chief, for the 1st Bengal
European Fusileers to march without delay to
Umb&acirc;la, where all the regiments from the hill
stations were to concentrate. They set out that
afternoon, and reached Umb&acirc;la, a distance of
sixty miles, on the morning of the second day.
From this point Lieutenant Hodson's narrative
commences. It is compiled from the letters or
bulletins which he sent day by day to his wife,
written as best they might, in any moments
which he could snatch from the overwhelming
press of work, sometimes on the field, sometimes
on horseback. It is almost unnecessary to observe,
that they were not intended for the public
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
eye, and would never have been published had
my lamented brother been alive, as he had the
greatest horror of any of his letters appearing in
print. Now, unhappily, the case is different, and
I feel, in common with many of his friends, that
in justice both to himself and to the gallant band
who formed the "army before Delhi," this record
of heroic fortitude and endurance ought not to be
withheld. It does not profess to be a history of
the siege, or military operations connected with
it; though it is a most valuable contribution to
any history, as Lieutenant Hodson, from his position
as head of the Intelligence Department,
knew better, probably, than any other man what
was going on both amongst the enemy and in
our own force; and his incidental notices will
tell, better, perhaps, than the most labored description,
what our men did and what they suffered.
Full justice will probably never be done
them, nor their trying position appreciated as it
ought to be; besiegers in name, though more
truly besieged; exposed to incessant attacks night
and day; continually thinned in numbers by the
sword, the bullet, the sunstroke, and cholera, and
for many weeks receiving no reinforcements;
feeling sometimes as if they were forgotten by
their countrymen, and yet holding their ground
against a nation in arms, without murmuring or
complaining, and with unshaken determination.
All accounts agree in speaking of the cheerful
and "plucky" spirit that prevailed, both amongst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
officers and men, notwithstanding fatigue, privation,
and sickness, as something quite remarkable
even amongst British soldiers. And if there
was one more than another who contributed to
inspire and keep up this spirit, if there was one
more than another who merited that which a
Roman would have considered the highest praise,
that he never despaired of his country, it was
Lieutenant Hodson. I have seen a letter from a
distinguished officer, in which he says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2">
"Affairs at times looked very queer, from the
frightful expenditure of life. Hodson's face was
then like sunshine breaking through the dark
clouds of despondency and gloom that would
settle down occasionally on all but a few brave
hearts, England's worthiest sons, who were determined
to conquer."
</p>

<p class="p2">If any should be disposed to think that my
brother, in these letters, speaks too exclusively of
his own doings, they must remember, in the first
place, to whom they were addressed; and secondly,
that in describing events&mdash;<i>quorum pars magna
fuit</i>&mdash;it would be almost impossible not to speak
of himself.</p>

<p>He himself, even in writing to his wife, thinks
it necessary to apologize for being "egotistical."
I believe, on the other hand, that the highest interest
of the following narrative will be found to
consist in its being a <i>personal</i> narrative, a history
of the man, an unreserved outspeaking of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
mind and feelings; nor am I afraid of others
thinking apology called for. Nor, however much
they may disagree from his criticisms on men and
measures, will they deny that he was well qualified,
both by his opportunities of observation at
the time, and his past experience of Asiatic character,
to form a judgment and express an opinion
without exposing himself to the charge of presumption.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left65">
<span class="smcap">Umb&acirc;la</span>, <i>May 15th, 1857</i>.</p>

<p>We got here after two nights of very harassing marching.
We started badly, the men having been drinking
before they came to parade, and they were hurried too
much in going down hill, consequently there was much
straggling; but, thanks to tattoos (ponies) and carts and
elephants, sent out to meet us, we got in to-day in tolerable
completeness. Affairs are very serious, and unless
very prompt and vigorous measures are taken, the whole
army, and perhaps a large portion of India, will be lost
to us. Delhi is in the hands of the mutineers,&mdash;no European
that we can hear of being left alive there,&mdash;men,
women, and children, all who were caught, have been
butchered! Brigadier Graves, Abbott, and some others
have escaped. Willoughby, the Ordnance Commissary in
charge of the magazine and arsenal, is said to have fired
it himself to prevent the mutineers having possession of
the contents to arm themselves with,&mdash;of course sacrificing
his own life to such a duty. A lac and a half
of muskets would otherwise have been in the hands of
the insurgents. The Commander-in-Chief came in this
morning. Here alarm is the prevalent feeling, and
conciliation, of men with arms in their hands and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
a state of absolute rebellion, the order of the day. This
system, if pursued, is far more dangerous than anything
the Sepoys can do to us. There is an outbreak at
Ferozepoor, but the Europeans have the fort in their
possession; if not, we should be without arms, for the
regiments here have no ammunition, and Philour, our
nearest source of supply, was nearly falling into the hands
of the Sepoys. Even now, some say it is at their mercy.
Fortunately the Maharaja of Puttiala is stanch, and so
are other Sikh chiefs hereabouts. We shall go on to
Delhi in a few days. That city is in the hands of the
insurgents, and the King proclaimed Emperor of Hindostan!
I do trust that the authorities will act with vigor,
else there is no knowing where the affair will end. Oh
for Sir Charles Napier now!
</p>

<p>
<i>16th.</i>&mdash;Little is known for certain of what is going on,
as there is no communication with, or from, below. At
present, the native troops have all gone off bodily; none
remain in cantonments. We march, I believe, on Monday,&mdash;9th
Lancers, 75th Queen's, 1st Fusileers, and nine
guns, taking the 5th, 60th Native Infantry, and 4th Cavalry
with us,&mdash;nice companions! However, they can do
us no harm, and they might do great mischief if left here.
There has been an outbreak at Ferozepoor and Philour,
but the magazine and bridge at the first place are safe in
the hands of her Majesty's 60th, and the authorities at
Jullundur sent off a party of Europeans and Horse Artillery
at once, who secured the fort at Philour; otherwise
we should have had no ammunition but what the soldiers
carried in their pouches. The times are critical,
but I have no fear of aught save the alarm and indecision
of our rulers. All here is sheer confusion, and there
is a tendency to treat these rebellious Sepoys with a tenderness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
as misplaced as it would be pernicious. There is
actually a talk of concentrating troops, and waiting to be
joined by others before marching on Delhi; and they
utterly refuse to detach even a party on Kurn&acirc;l to protect
the officers and treasury there. This is all very sad,
and sometimes makes one disposed to question whether
we are not suffering from the "dementia" which Providence
sends as the forerunner of ruin. However, our
course is not yet run, and whatever clouds may gather
over us, there are good results in store. The Punjaub is
quiet. The native troops at Mean-Meer were quietly
disarmed, and do their guards with bayonets only. This
excellent arrangement is Sir John Lawrence's doing.
Nothing is known of Lucknow, or indeed of any place
below Meerut. Allygurh is supposed to have gone.
Some details of the massacre at Delhi, which I have just
heard from one of the escapees, are awful beyond belief.
Charlie Thomason is said to have escaped; Mr. Jennings,
the chaplain, and his daughter were among the victims.
Mr. Beresford, his wife, and five daughters all massacred.
Poor Colonel Ripley lived long enough to say he was
killed by his own men. De Teissier's native artillerymen
joined the rebels with their guns;&mdash;he escaped,
though severely wounded.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i>&mdash;We are all terribly anxious about the hill stations,
reports having reached us that the Goorkhas have
mutinied and attacked Simla. 100 men, with ammunition,
have gone off this morning to Kussowlee. Dugshai is
easily defended. Simla is most to be feared....
All this has put out of my head for the time the good
news for us. Yesterday I was sent for by the Commander-in-Chief,
and appointed Assistant Quartermaster-General
on his personal staff, to be under the immediate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
orders of his Excellency, and with command to raise
100 horse and 50 foot, for service in the Intelligence
Department, and as personal escort. All this was done,
moreover, in a most complimentary way, and it is quite
in my line. I am prepared to set to work vigorously;
but I confess my anxiety on account of the reports we
hear respecting the hill stations makes me cruelly anxious....
General Anson, it seems, wrote about
me to Talbot, but could get no answer before the outbreak
occurred, which makes this act of his, on his own
responsibility, the more complimentary. It is very uncertain
now when we move on. All is quiet in the Punjaub,
I am thankful to say, and the rebels have had
a lesson read them at Ferozepoor which will do good.
The 45th Native Infantry were nearly cut to pieces by
the 10th Light Cavalry,<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> who pursued them for twelve
miles, and cut them to pieces. This last is a great fact.
One regiment at least has stood by us, and the moral
effect will be great; nothing known yet from below.
Poor Macdonald, of the 20th Native Infantry, his wife,
and their three babes, murdered, with adjuncts not to
be mentioned. John Lawrence is acting with great
vigor, and they have organized a movable force at
Jhelum, composed of her Majesty's 24th and 27th, the
Guides, Kum&agrave;on Battalion, and other Irregulars, to move
in any required direction. Montgomery writes in great
spirits and confidence from Lahore. I am just sent for
by the chief.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kurn&acirc;l</span>, <i>May 18th</i>.&mdash;According to orders, I left
Umb&acirc;la at 8.30 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>, and reached here at 4.30 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>,
having prepared everything at Peeplee <i>en route</i>. I had
only "Bux"<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> with me, and did not apprehend any danger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
until within a few miles of Kurn&acirc;l, but nothing
whatever happened; the road was deserted, and not a
soul to be seen. I am sheltered in a house occupied by
the refugees from Delhi and the civil officers of Kurn&acirc;l,
about fifteen in all, with Mrs. Wagentrieber, her husband,
and sundry sergeants, &amp;c. The European troops
will be here to-night. What would I not give for a
couple of hundred of my old Guides! I flatter myself
I could do something then. As it is, I must bide my
time until I can get a few good men together on whom
I can depend. I have been so busy all day, writing letters
on my knee, sending off electric messages, <i>cum multis
aliis</i>. I can but rejoice that I am employed again; certain,
too, as I am, that the star of Old England will
shine the brighter in the end, and we shall hold a prouder
position than ever. But the crisis is an awful one!</p>

<p><i>May 19th.</i>&mdash;This morning the Commander-in-Chief
ordered me to raise and command an entire new regiment
of Irregular Horse. I do not know who or what
has been at work for me, but he seems willing enough to
give me work to do, and I am willing enough to do it.
The European troops arrived this morning (I sent a telegraphic
message to say so); and the Rajah of Jheend,
with his men, last night. I have offered to clear the
road and open the communication to Meerut and Delhi
with the Rajah's Horse. If the Chief will consent, I
think I am sure of success. It is believed that nothing
has occurred at Agra. The Punjaub all quiet up to last
night; as long as that is the case we shall do. With
God and our Saxon arms to aid us, I have firm faith in
the result.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i>&mdash;Deep anxiety about the safety of the hill stations
continues unabated; no letters,&mdash;no certainty,&mdash;only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
rumors. Were it not for this, I should enter with
full zest into the work before me, and the fresh field
which I owe to General Anson's kindness. He has at
last consented to my trying to open communication with
Meerut, so I start this afternoon to try to make my way
across with a party of the Jheend Horse; and I have,
under Providence, little doubt of success, though I would
rather have a party of my dear old Guides. There has
been an outbreak at Agra, but all the Europeans are
shut up in the fort; Allygurh and Moradabad have mutinied,
but by God's help we shall get safely through.</p>

<p><i>20th</i>, 2 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>&mdash;Just one line to say I am starting, and
shall not be able to write to-morrow or next day. Still
no tidings from the hills! This is a terrible additional
pull upon one's nerves at a time like this, and is a phase
of war I never calculated on.</p>

<p><i>May 24th.</i>&mdash;I returned from my expedition to Meerut
late last night. It was eminently successful, and I
am off immediately to Umb&acirc;la to report progress to the
Chief. Much relieved by a letter from you.</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>&mdash;A hurried line only to say I am safe and well,
but dead beat. I went yesterday to Umb&acirc;la by mail-cart
to report to the Commander-in-Chief. Got there at
6 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>, and started back again at 11 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> As I have
only had one night in bed out of five, I am tolerably
weary. The Commander-in-Chief arrived this morning.
I will give you more particulars when I have slept.
</p>
</div>

<p>From a letter written from camp before Delhi,
in August, to Colonel D. Seaton:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
... "As soon as the Commander-in-Chief reached
Umb&acirc;la he sent for me, and put me in charge of the Intelligence
Department, as an Assistant Quartermaster-General
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
General under his personal orders. I left Umb&acirc;la by
mail-cart that night for Kurn&acirc;l, ascertained the state of
things, made arrangements for the protection and shelter
of the advanced party, and offered to open the road to
Meerut, from Kurn&acirc;l. He replied by telegraph. Seventy-two
hours afterwards, I was back in Kurn&acirc;l, and
telegraphed to him that I had forced my way to Meerut,<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
and obtained all the papers he wanted from the General
there. These I gave him four hours later in Umb&acirc;la.
The pace pleased him, I fancy, for he ordered me to
raise a Corps of Irregular Horse, and appointed me
Commandant."
</p>
</div>

<hr class="l15" />

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>May 25th, Evening.</i>&mdash;I wrote this morning a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
hurried lines to keep you from anxiety. I was too tired
to do more, the continued night-work had wearied me out,
and when I got back here at half-past six this morning I
was fairly dead beat. Poor Charlie Thomason is with
me. I am happy to have been in some measure instrumental
in getting him in in safety, by offering a heavy
sum to the villagers. He had been wandering about in
the jungles, with several other refugees, for days, without
food or shelter. I am deeply grieved for him, poor fellow!
The state of panic at Meerut was shocking; all
the ladies shut up in an inclosed barrack, and their husbands
sleeping in the men's barracks for safety, and never
going beyond the sentries.</p>

<p>General Hewitt is in a state of helpless imbecility.
The best and boldest spirit there was our friend Alfred
Light, doing his work manfully and well. He had had
some miraculous escapes. My commission is to raise a
body of Irregular Horse on the usual rates of pay and
the regular complement of native officers, but the number
of troops to be unlimited,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, I am to raise as
many men as I please; 2,000, if I can get them. The
worst of it is, the being in a part of the country I do
not know, and the necessity of finding men who can be
trusted. Mr. Montgomery is aiding me wonderfully. He
called upon some of my old friends among the Sirdars
to raise men for me. Shumshere Singh is raising one
troop; Tej Singh ditto; Emaumoodeen ditto; Mr. Montgomery
himself one or two ditto. All these will be ready
in about three weeks. I am to remain Assistant Quartermaster-General,
attached to the Commander-in-Chief.
This allows me free access to him at any time, and to
other people in authority, which gives me power for
good. The Intelligence Department is mine exclusively,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
and I have for this line Sir Henry's old friend, the one-eyed
Moulvie, Rujub Alee, so I shall get the best news
in the country. Montgomery has come out very, very
strong indeed, and behaved admirably. The native regiments
at Peshawur have been disarmed. One at Naoshera
(the 55th) was sent over to occupy Murd&acirc;n in the
absence of the Guides. They have mutinied, and seized
the fort, and confined the Assistant Commissioner. General
Cotton is going against them, and the Euzofzai folks
will do their best to prevent a man escaping. As yet the
Punjaub is quiet, and the Irregulars true. The Guides
are coming down here by forced marches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camp, Paneeput</span>, <i>27th</i>.&mdash;I wrote to you this morning,
but as I shall not probably be in the way of d&acirc;ks
to-morrow, I write a few lines to be sent after I start
onwards. You will have heard of the sad death of General
Anson. He was taken with cholera yesterday, and
died without pain from collapse this morning. He made
over command to General Barnard with his last breath.
Sir Henry only arrived from Umb&acirc;la just in time. His
death is politically a vast misfortune just at this crisis,
and personally I am deeply grieved, and the natives will
be highly elated. I am even now hard at work, raising
my men, or taking means to do so, and have already had
applications for officers; but I shall not settle on officers
till the men begin to collect, and this time I will take care
to have none but gentlemen, if I can help it. I am going
downwards to-night to look after the bridge<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> on this side
of Delhi, about thirty miles hence, by which the Meerut
troops will move to join us. I take the Jheend Horse;
Colonel T. Seaton is commanding the 60th Native Infantry,
and will be here to-night with them. I don't envy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
him his new command, but he is a good man, and a brave
soldier, and if any man can get them over the mess, he
will do it. Sir H. Barnard is a fine gentlemanly old
man, but hardly up to his work. However, we must all
put our shoulders to the wheel, and help him over the
crisis. I trust he will act with vigor, for we have delayed
far too long already.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>&mdash;There is nothing new. I travelled eighty
miles between 2 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> yesterday, and ten this morning,
besides heaps of business. I am tired, I confess, for the
heat is awful. The treasuries are empty, and no drafts
are to be cashed, so how we are to get money I cannot
imagine. We hear that a request has gone to Lord
Canning to send for Pat Grant as Commander-in-Chief,
pending instructions. I grieve for poor General
Anson, and I ought to do so, for he was a good friend
to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sumalka</span>, <i>30th</i>.&mdash;My earnest representations and remonstrances
seem at last to have produced some effect,
for at 7 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> yesterday we got an order to move on. The
head-quarters follow us to-night from Kurn&acirc;l. The "we"
means three squadrons of 9th Lancers, Money's troop of
Horse Artillery, and 1st Fusileers. Brigadier Hallifax is
in command, but so ill from heat and anxiety, that I begin
to be anxious about him, and whether he will be able
to remain with the force is doubtful. Colonel T. Seaton
has gone on to Rohtuck with the 60th Native Infantry,
who, I have no doubt, will desert to a man as soon as
they get there. It is very plucky of him and the other
officers to go; and very hard of the authorities to send
them; a half-hearted measure, and very discreditable, in
my opinion, to all concerned; affording a painful contrast
to Sir John Lawrence's bold and decided conduct in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
crisis. The old Guides are to be here on the 8th or 10th
to join us. The heat here is a caution, and writing in
this melting climate anything but easy, especially as
chairs and tables are not common. This regiment (1st
Fusileers) is a credit to any army, and the fellows are in
as high spirits and heart, and as plucky and free from
croaking as possible, and really do good to the whole
force.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kussowlee</span>, <i>May 31st</i>.&mdash;Here we are one more
stage on our road to Delhi; we are, however, to halt a
couple of days or so at the next stage (Raee), to await
the arrival of General Barnard. Poor Brigadier Hallifax
was so ill that he would clearly have died had he
remained here, so we had a medical committee, put him
into my shigram (a travelling wagon), and sent him off
to Kurn&acirc;l for Umb&acirc;la and the hills. I sent a telegraphic
message for Mrs. Hallifax to meet him at Umb&acirc;la.
This is but the beginning of this work, I fear; and before
this business ends, we who are, thank God! still young
and strong shall alone be left in camp; all the elderly
gentlemen will sink under the fatigue and exposure. I
think of asking for Mr. Macdowell as my second in command;
he is a gentleman, and only wants opportunity to
become a gallant soldier. The whole onus of work here
is on my shoulders; every one comes to me for advice
and assistance, which is purely absurd. I shall do all
the work and others get the credit, as usual; but in these
days we cannot afford to spare ourselves. The Empire is
at stake, and all we love and reverence is in the balance.
I tried to persuade them to send General Johnstone to
Meerut to supersede Hewitt. I wish he had been there
and was here; we have few as good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Raee</span>, <i>June 1st</i>.&mdash;I have just been roused up from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
the first sleep I have had, for I don't know how long,
(lying under a peepul-tree, with a fine breeze like liquid
fire blowing over me,) by the news that the d&acirc;k is going,
so I can only say that all is well, and that we are here,
about twenty miles from Delhi, and I hope ere night to
capture some of the rascals who stripped and ill-treated
two ladies near this the other day on their flight to the
hills.</p>

<p>Colonel Hope Grant has arrived to command the
force until General Barnard comes, which will be on the
4th, and the Meerut people also. The Delhi mutineers
marched out ten miles, and attacked Brigadier Wilson
on the night of the 30th, at Ghazeenuggur, on his way
to this place. He drove them back, and captured all
their guns. Some 8,000 or 10,000 of them came out,
and he had only about 1,000 men. Long odds, this; but
of course all his men were Europeans. I fear the 14th
Irregulars have joined the mutineers. If they would
only make haste and get to Delhi, we might do something.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Raee</span>, <i>2d</i>.&mdash;You will have been as much shocked as
I was by the tidings of poor Brigadier Hallifax's death
at Kurn&acirc;l, only a few hours after I had put him into the
carriage, with the comfortable assurance that his wife
would meet him at Umb&acirc;la. He died from congestion
of the brain. I have been much affected by this, for I
had a warm regard for him, and his very helplessness
the last few days seemed to strengthen the tie. I feel
deeply for his poor wife and children. Colonel Mowat
of the artillery is dead too, of cholera. The weather is
undoubtedly very trying for old and infirm men; but we
are all well here, and there is no sickness to speak of
among the troops. All will be here to-morrow. Headquarters,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
75th, Queen's, and remainder of 9th Lancers;
the heavy guns and 2d Fusileers are only a short way
behind. Colonel Hope Grant commands. The Meerut
folks have had another fight (on the 31st) with the Delhi
mutineers, and again beaten them; but this constant exposure
is very trying to Europeans. I wish we were
moving nearer Delhi more rapidly, as all now depends
on our quickly disposing of this mighty sore. I wish
from my heart we had Sir Henry Lawrence here; he is
the man for the crisis. We are all in high spirits; only
eager to get at the villains who have committed atrocities
which make the blood run cold but to think of. I trust
the retribution will be short, sharp, and decisive.</p>

<p>Another batch of half-starved, half-naked Europeans,
men, women, and children (a deputy collector and his
family), were brought into camp to-day, after wandering
twenty-three days in the jungle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Raee</span>, <i>3d</i>.&mdash;Things are so quiet in the Punjaub that
I begin to hope that, if we do but make haste in disposing
of Delhi, the campaign may not be so long, after all.
Everything depends on that; we dare not, however, calculate
on such good fortune either to our arms or ourselves.
The head-quarters' people joined this morning;
they seem to stand it better than I expected. Congreve
complains a good deal, but Keith Young and Arthur
Becher are well. I have not yet seen Sir H. Barnard.
I was kept up and out half the night, and then out again
at daybreak, so I am too tired and busy to pay visits.
There has been no further fight that we know of. Charlie
Thomason rejoined us this morning; he has picked
up a little since his starvation time ended, and does not
look so like a wild beast as he did. Still good news
from Agra; there are, however, reports which tend to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
show disturbances in the Allyghur and Bolundshur districts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aleepore</span>, <i>5th</i>.&mdash;You must not be anxious on my
account; I am in as good a position as possible for a
subaltern to be, unless, indeed, I had my regiment ready
for service. I am second only to Becher in the Quarter-master-General
Department, and the Intelligence Department
is entirely my own. I feel deeply for poor
Mrs. Hallifax and her large family, and am delighted
that you are able to aid them. I have tried everywhere
to get a bearer, but the natives will not serve us now,
and I could get no one even on double pay. Only two
days ago I succeeded in getting a Bheestie. If we
could but get all the seventy-four native infantry regiments
in one lump we could manage them, but they will
never stand after we get our guns to work. I rode right
up to the Delhi parade-ground this morning to reconnoitre,
and the few Sowars, whom I met, galloped away
like mad at the sight of one white face. Had I had a
hundred Guides with me I would have gone up to the
very walls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aleepore</span>, <i>6th</i>.&mdash;All the force is assembled to-day
save the Meerut portion, and they will be up to-night;
the heat is severe, but not unhealthy. The siege guns
came in this morning, and the 2d European Bengal Fusileers,
and we are all ready to move on. About 2,000 of
the rebels have come out of Delhi, and put themselves
in position to bar our road. Even your pride would be
satisfied at the cry when I ride to the front or start on
any little excursion. I think I am more than appreciated
by the head-quarters' people. I had barely finished the
word when I was sent for by the General, and had a
pretty strong proof of the estimation I am held in. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
had been urged to one particular point of attack; and
when I went into the tent, he immediately turned to the
assembled council, and said, "I have always trusted to
Hodson's intelligence, and have the greatest confidence
in his judgment. I will be guided by what he can tell
me now." So the croakers, who had been groaning,
were discomfited. This is of course for your own eye
and ear alone, but it is pleasant, as the General has only
known me since he has now joined the force.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aleepore</span>, <i>June 7th</i>.&mdash;I have little to do with the
"Jheend Rajah's troops," further than that I am empowered
to demand as many as I want, and whenever
I want them. I have twenty-five men on constant duty
with me, and to-day have asked for double that number
for extra duty; beyond this, I have not, and do not wish
to have, further to do with them. All Rohilcund is in
mutiny. In fact, the district of Agra is the only one in
the Northwest Provinces now under our control. What
a terrible lesson on the evils of delay! It will be long
yet, I fear, ere this business is over. Oh for Sir Henry
Lawrence! Yet personally I have no reason to complain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camp, Delhi</span>, <i>June 8th, 1857</i>.&mdash;Here we are safe
and sound, after having driven the enemy out of their
position in the cantonments up to and into the walls of
Delhi! I write a line in pencil on the top of a drum to
say that I am mercifully untouched, and none the worse
for a very hard morning's work. Our loss has been considerable,
the rebels having been driven from their guns
at the point of the bayonet. Poor Colonel Chester killed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
at the first fire. Alfred Light (who won the admiration
of all) wounded, but not severely. No one else of the
staff party killed or wounded; but our general returns
will, I fear, tell a sad tale. Greville slightly hurt. The
enemy's guns captured, and their dispersion and rout
very complete. God has been very good to me. May
His gracious protection still be shown!

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left55">
<span class="smcap">Camp before Delhi</span>, <i>June 9th</i>.
</p>

<p>I wrote you a few hurried lines on the field of battle
yesterday, to say that we had beaten the enemy, and
driven them back five miles into Delhi. How grateful
rest was after such a morning! The Guides came in to-day,
and it would have done your heart good to see the
welcome they gave me&mdash;cheering and shouting and
crowding round me like frantic creatures. They seized
my bridle, dress, hands, and feet, and literally threw
themselves down before the horse with the tears streaming
down their faces. Many officers who were present
hardly knew what to make of it, and thought the creatures
were mobbing me; and so they were,&mdash;but for joy,
not for mischief<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>. All the staff were witnesses of this,
and Colonel Becher says their reception of me was quite
enough to contradict all the reports of my unpopularity<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
with the regiment. There is terrible confusion all along
the road, and we can only get the d&acirc;ks carried at all by
bribery, stage by stage.

<div class="blockquot">

<p>
<i>June 10th.</i>&mdash;When I hastily closed my letter yesterday,
I hoped to be able to write a long one for to-day's
d&acirc;k, and to have had some hours' quiet to myself; but
before the post had well started, our troops were again
under arms, the mutineers having thought proper to attack
our position; consequently I was on horseback the
whole day, and thankful to get at night a mouthful of
food and a little rest. I had command of all the troops
on our right, the gallant Guides among the rest. They
followed me with a cheer for their old commander, and
behaved with their usual pluck; but I grieve deeply to
say that poor Quintin Battye was mortally wounded.
He behaved most nobly, Daly tells me, leading his men
like a hero. Poor Khan Singh Rosah, who had come
down from the Punjaub to join me only the same morning,
was badly shot through the shoulder. Indeed, I did
<i>not</i> expose myself unnecessarily, for, having to direct the
movements of three or four regiments, I could not be in
the front as much as I wished. God has mercifully preserved
me, and I humbly pray will continue His gracious
care. The warmth of the reception again given me by
the Guides was quite affecting, and has produced a great
sensation in camp, and had a good effect on our native
troops, insomuch that they are more willing to obey their
European officers when they see their own countrymen's
enthusiasm. Numbers of the men want to come and
join my new regiment,&mdash;in fact, the largest proportion
of the cavalry; but of course I cannot take them now,
nor until this business is over. I am wonderfully well,
and only a little anxious about the hill stations, though I
have full confidence in Lord William Hay's management.
There is not much sickness in camp, though many
wounded, and there will be many more, I fear, before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
we get into Delhi. We have been fortunate in the
weather hitherto.</p>

<p>The enemy are at least four or five times our strength,
and their numbers tell when we come near them, despite
their want of discipline. They are splendid artillery-men,
however, and actually beat ours in accuracy of fire.</p>

<p>Light works on magnificently, despite a severe and
painful wound in the head. I was very nearly coming
to grief once this morning, for the sabre I thought such
a good one went the first blow, and the blade flew out of
the handle the second, the handle itself breaking in two.
I had to borrow a sword from a horse artillery-man for
the remainder of the day.</p>

<p>The Jheend men with me fought like excellent soldiers.
The good General came up when it was over and shook
hands with me, and then with the men nearest. Their
Rajah has given the native officer a pair of gold bangles,
and doubled his pay. This is the way to encourage soldiers,
European as well as native: reward them, if but
with thanks, on the spot.</p>

<p>Colonel Thomas Seaton is at Rohtuck, in command of
the 60th Native Infantry. How much longer they will
refrain from mutiny one cannot say; certainly not long;
though if any man can keep them steady, Seaton will. I
hear some 300 or 400 men are ready for me; a few have
already arrived with Khan Singh. Meantime my position
is Assistant Quartermaster-General on the Commander-in-Chief's
personal staff. I am responsible for
the Intelligence Department, and in the field, or when
anything is going on, for directing the movements of the
troops in action, under the immediate orders of the General;
I have no other master, and he listens to my suggestions
most readily. Charlie Thomason is here, working
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
away as an engineer. Macdowell is well and merry,
and much gratified at my having asked for him.</p>

<p><i>June 14th.</i>&mdash;We were roused up three times during
the night, and I have been deep in business with the
General all the morning. I was also interrupted by the
mournful task of carrying poor Battye to his grave; the
brave boy died last night, with a smile on his lip, and a
Latin quotation on his tongue, "Dulce et decorum est
pro patri&acirc; mori." Poor fellow! he had quite won my
heart by his courage and amiable qualities, and it is very,
very sad, his early death. It was a noble one, however,
and worthy of a soldier. We have just been excited in
camp by the hasty arrival of Colonel Seaton and the officers
of the late 60th Native Infantry, which mutinied
yesterday, and, spite of all Seaton could do, they fired on
their officers, who, however, all escaped and came into
camp safe, after a ride of fifty miles. Seaton is with me,
looking terribly worn and harassed, but he says quite well
in health, though disgusted enough. Dr. Coghlan (75th
Regiment) died of cholera last night, but, thank God!
there are no other cases in camp. I am much vexed at
the <i>Lahore Chronicle</i> "butter," and wish people would
leave me alone in the newspapers. The best "butter" I
get is the deference and respect I meet with from all
whose respect I care for, and the affectionate enthusiasm
of the Guides, which increases instead of lessening.</p>

<p><i>June 12th.</i>&mdash;We were turned out early this morning
by an attack on our outposts and position generally by
the rebel army. A sharp fight ensued, which lasted some
four hours. The enemy came on very boldly, and had
got close to us, under cover of the trees and gardens,
before they were seen; however, the troops turned out
sharp, and drove them back quickly from our immediate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
vicinity; they were then followed up, and got most heartily
thrashed. They have never yet been so punished as
to-day. I estimate their loss in killed alone at 400, while
our loss was comparatively trifling. The Guides behaved
admirably, so did the Fusileers, as usual. Jacob's wing
was the admiration of all; one officer (Captain Knox,
75th) was killed, and one or two wounded, I do not know
how many European soldiers; but on the whole the affair
was a very creditable one. I am safe and sound still,
and again have to thank the Almighty for my preservation.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I was ordered by the General to assist
Greathed, and one or two more engineers, in forming
a project of attack, and how we would do to take Delhi.
We drew up our scheme and gave it to the General, who
highly approved, and will, I trust, carry it out; but how
times must be changed, when four subalterns are called
upon to suggest a means of carrying out so vitally important
an enterprise as this, one on which the safety of
the Empire depends! Wilberforce Greathed is next
senior engineer to Laughton. Chesney is Major of the
Engineer Brigade, and Maunsell commands the Sappers,
so they had official claims to be consulted.</p>

<p>I was added, because the General complimentarily told
me he had the utmost value for my opinion, and though
I am known to counsel vigorous measures, it is equally
well known I do not urge others to do what I would not
be the first to do myself. It is a much more serious business
than was at first anticipated. Delhi is a very strong
place, and the vast resources which the possession of our
arsenal has given the mutineers, has made the matter a
difficult one to deal with, except by the boldest measures;
the city should be carried by a <i>coup-de-main</i>, and that at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
once, or we may be many weeks before Delhi, instead of
within it. All is safe at Agra, and the 3d Europeans
are quietly under cover. A large party of us have just
been listening to a letter from Lord W. Hay, in which he
speaks in the highest terms of the conduct of some of
the ladies at Simla, and says that the sense and courage
exhibited by one or two of them has given a severe lesson
to those who ought to know better than to require it
from the weaker sex.</p>

<p><i>June 13th.</i>&mdash;We were to have taken Delhi by assault
last night, but a "mistake of orders," (?) as to the right
time of bringing the troops to the rendezvous, prevented
its execution. I am much annoyed and disappointed at
our plan not having been carried out, because I am confident
it would have been successful. The rebels were
cowed, and perfectly ignorant of any intention of so bold
a stroke on our part as an assault; the surprise would
have done everything. I am very vexed, though the
General is most kind and considerate in trying to soothe
my disappointment,&mdash;too kind, indeed, or he would not
so readily have pardoned those whose fault it is that we
are still outside Delhi.</p>

<p><i>June 14th.</i>&mdash;There was another smart engagement last
night, the 60th Native Infantry having thought fit to signalize
their arrival at Delhi by an attack upon our position;
they suffered for it, as usual, but also, as usual, we
lost several good men whom, God knows, we can ill spare.
Mr. Kennedy was wounded, and a Subadar and some men
of the Guides killed. I was not very much under fire,
though I had to run the gantlet now and then of a rain
of shot and shells with which the rebels belabored us.
Our artillery officers themselves say that they are outmatched
by these rascals in accuracy and rapidity of fire;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
and as they have unlimited supplies of guns and ammunition
from our own greatest arsenal, they are quite beyond
us in many respects. I am just returned from a
long ride to look after a party of plunderers from the
city, who had gone round our flank; I disposed of a few.</p>

<p><i>June 15th.</i>&mdash;I have had a night and day of great
anxiety, owing to fresh rumors of an outbreak at Simla.
I have much confidence in Lord W. Hay's judgment
and management of the natives, but this would not be
sufficient, were the station once attacked. The d&acirc;k,
however, has arrived, and quieted our apprehensions.
There was a sharp fight again this morning, which lasted
some hours; our loss was not great, but every man is a
loss. Our project for the assault is still approved of and
entertained, but put off from day to day, till it will be too
late. It is now noon, and I have been out since daybreak,
and must get breakfast.</p>

<p><i>June 16th.</i>&mdash;Everybody here is infinitely disgusted at
learning the truth about the report of a riot at Simla,
and the opinion is universal that &mdash;&mdash; ought to be removed.
Neville Chamberlain is Adjutant-General of
the army, and Pat Grant Commander-in-Chief. I do
not think either of them will approve of any "soldier"
showing his prowess in fighting helpless women and children,
or of one whose only courage is exhibited on a
peaceful parade, or when an unfortunate subaltern is to
be bullied. The weather is intense to-day, and I am
uncomfortable from having caught a heavy cold, but it
will soon go off, I dare say. I mentioned that four of us
had been ordered to prepare a project of attack, and that
we had suggested and arranged a bold but perfectly feasible
<i>coup-de-main</i>; it was approved and ordered, but in
consequence of &mdash;&mdash;'s not bringing up his troops, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
forced to be abandoned; it has again been ordered, countermanded,
and finally abandoned. A council of war sat
yesterday, and resolved to wait for reinforcements!! our
scheme, however, is on record, and our names attached.
General Barnard told me yesterday he wished I was a
captain, for he would pledge himself to get me a majority
for what I had already done; he thought he "might
safely promise <i>that</i> at least." But, alas! I am not a
captain.</p>

<p><i>June 18th.</i>&mdash;I was not able to write yesterday, for the
cold I mentioned as having caught in common with many
others in camp, turned into a sharp attack of bronchitis,
or inflammation on the chest, and I was really very ill
for some hours. To-day I am thankful to say I am much
better, though very weak; the inflammation has disappeared,
and I hope to be on my horse again to-morrow, in
spite of all the doctor says. Every one is very kind, the
General particularly so; he insists on having me in his
own tent, as being so much larger than my own, and he
takes the most fatherly care of me. I can see no reason
strong enough to induce me to consent to any ladies coming
to camp; it is true that a Captain &mdash;&mdash;, who with his
wife escaped from Delhi to Umb&acirc;la, has dragged the unfortunate
woman back here again, though expecting her
confinement, and with not a shadow of comfort or shelter,
except a tent. Even Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;,<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and all the others of
her sex, have been sent back to Meerut; they never
ought to have been allowed to come with us; the greatest
consolation to us here is the thought that those dearest to
us are in safety, and free from the heat and dangers and
annoyances of our life here. Poor Brown was badly
wounded last night in the shoulder. I much fear that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
Dr. Hay has been murdered at Bareilly; his name is
among the missing, and scarcely a hope remains.</p>

<p><i>June 19th.</i>&mdash;I am up and dressed, and crawling about
a little to-day, but much weaker than I fancied, and dizzy
with quinine, and vexed at being useless at such a time.
The General nurses me as if I were his son. I woke in
the night, and found the kind old man by my bedside,
covering me carefully up from the draught. The delay
and absolute want of progress here is very disheartening.
There have been repeated attacks upon us; all of course
with the same result, (but, for that matter, we are as
nearly besieged as the rebels themselves are,) and we
lose valuable lives in every encounter, the sum total of
which would swell the catalogue to the dimensions of that
of a general engagement. Our plan of carrying the city
by a <i>coup-de-main</i> was frustrated the first night by the
fears and absolute disobedience of orders of &mdash;&mdash;, the
man who first lost Delhi, and has now by folly prevented
its being recaptured. The General has twice since
wished and even ordered it, but has always been thwarted
by some one or other; latterly by that old woman &mdash;&mdash;, who
has come here for nothing, apparently, but as
an obstacle; &mdash;&mdash; is also a crying evil to us. The General
knows this, and wants to get rid of him, but has not
the nerve to supersede him; the whole state of affairs
here is bad to a degree; it is true we always thrash the
fellows when we can get at them, for they are contemptible
as an enemy in the open field, being formidable in
numbers only; but the immense resources placed in their
hands, by the possession of our magazine and arsenal, inside
a walled and fortified town, make it very difficult for
an army, unless provided with a proper siege equipment
and engineer park, to drive them out in orthodox fashion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
we have certainly plenty of guns, but we have not men to
work them; and of the latter, thanks to &mdash;&mdash;, we have
absolutely nothing, so we do nothing but fire away long
shots at the distance of a mile, and repel the enemy's
attacks; instead of which we ought to have had our batteries
close up to the walls, and been through them, days
ago. It was from the conviction that we had no regular
means of reducing the place by the fire of our artillery,
and at the distance we now are from the walls, and that
it was vain to expect our commandant of artillery to
attempt any bolder stroke than ordinary with the few
guns for which he had hands, which induced me to press
the capture of the place by assault, blowing open the
gates with powder bags, and rushing in with the bayonet.
All was arranged, and under Providence I venture to
believe success was certain, but as I say, all was frustrated
by terror and disobedience. I fear now nothing
can be done for many days, and until other troops arrive;
meanwhile the evil is spreading, and disaffection, to use a
mild term, increasing. I fear there is no room to doubt
that Dr. Hay is dead; he was actually hung, with other
civilians, in the market-place at Bareilly, after going
through a mock form of trial. All the Europeans at
Shahjehanpoor have, we hear, been murdered while they
were in church, at the same moment, as nearly as possible,
that the Bareilly tragedy was going on.</p>

<p><i>June 20th.</i>&mdash;I am much better to-day, but still very
weak, yet work I must. There was a sharp fight again
last evening. The enemy came down and attacked our
rear, and a sharp conflict ensued between some 2,000
Sepoys with six guns, and 300 Europeans with one
gun. The result was as usual, but two events occurred
which were important for me. Colonel Becher was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
shot through the right arm, and Captain Daly badly hit
through the shoulder.</p>

<p>The consequence is, that I have in effect to see to the
whole work of the Quartermaster-General of the army;
and in addition, the General has begged me as a personal
favor to take command of the Guides until Daly has
recovered. I at first refused, but the General was most
urgent, putting it on the ground that the service was at
stake, and none was so fit, &amp;c. &amp;c. I do feel that we are
bound to do our best just now to put things on a proper
footing, and after consulting Seaton and Norman, I accepted
the command. How &mdash;&mdash; will gnash his teeth to
see me leading my dear old Guides again in the field.
If I can but keep it till Delhi is taken I shall be satisfied,
for I think I shall be able to do something towards so
favorable a result. Shebbeare was appointed second in
command at my request. He is an excellent soldier.
General Barnard<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> has written most strongly in my
favor, and has voluntarily pledged himself to get me my
majority as soon as ever I am a captain. I confess I feel
a little proud at being earnestly requested to take again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
the command of which the machinations of my enemies
had deprived me. Our loss altogether last night was not
more than 50 killed and wounded; we took two guns;&mdash;enemy's
loss about 500.
</p>

<p><i>June 21st.</i>&mdash;I have been on horseback to-day for the
first time since this attack of illness, so I may be considered
finally recovered, only I still feel considerable weakness.
It is very annoying not to be quite up to the mark
in these stirring times, especially when so much work has
fallen to my lot. I am fortunate, however, in not being,
like many of our poor fellows, laid up with wounds and
serious ailments. God has been very good to me, and in
nothing more so than in preserving what is most precious
to me from the horrible danger and suffering of so many
of our poor countrywomen and children. How thankful
I am now that Reginald exchanged into an European
corps. I never see any of these unhappy refugees, as we
call the poor officers whose regiments have mutinied,
wandering about the camp, without uttering a mental
thanksgiving that he is safe from that at least. I feel
more strongly every hour that I should not have been
justified in refusing the command of the Guides under
present circumstances. We are, in point of fact, reduced
to merely holding our own ground till we get more men.
The drain on our resources has been enormous, while
those of the enemy have proved so much greater, both
in men, ammunition, and strength of position, than we
expected, and they have fought us so much more perseveringly
than was deemed possible, that it has become
imperatively necessary to be stronger before striking the
final blow. The plan for carrying the city<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> by assault,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
which I feel convinced would then have been successful,
has now become impracticable. The enemy are stronger,
we are weaker; besides that, they would be prepared for
any <i>coup-de-main</i> now. General Johnstone is to be here
by the 23d, we hope with considerable reinforcements,
and more will follow. I trust that a few days then will
end this business, as far as Delhi is concerned, and so
enable a part, at least, of the force to move on towards
Allygurh, and reopen the roads and d&acirc;ks, and restore
order for the time; but when the end will be, who can
say?</p>

<p>The rising in Rohilcund will, I fear, assume formidable
proportions and give us much trouble, as I think we
shall scarcely be able to do anything there before the
cold weather. There is, in fact, every prospect of a long
and tedious campaign. May God's wisdom direct and
His mercy defend us!</p>

<p><i>June 22d.</i>&mdash;The hottest day we have had yet; but
while I know that the hill stations are quiet, I can bear
anything with equanimity. The rumors down here, of
all that has been doing and feared at Simla, have been
enough to unnerve any one who does not know the truth.
Lord W. Hay's judgment and energy deserve every
praise. Personally, I cannot but feel gratified at the
marked pleasure all hands, high and low, have shown at
my renewed command of the Guides. All congratulate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
me as if they were personally interested; and as to the
men themselves, their vociferous, and I really believe
honest, delight is quite overpowering. The wounded
generally are doing well, poor fellows, considering the
heat, dirt, and want of any bed but the dry ground.
Their pluck is wonderful, and it is not in the field alone
that you see what an English soldier is made of. One
poor fellow who was smoking his pipe and laughing with
the comrade by his side, was asked, what was the matter
with him, and he answered in a lively voice, "Oh, not
much, sir, only a little knock on the back; I shall be up
and at the rascals again in a day or two." He had been
shot in the spine, and all his lower limbs were paralyzed.
He died next day. Colonel Welchman<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> is about again;
too soon, I fear, but there is no keeping the brave old
man quiet. Poor Peter Brown<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> is very badly wounded,
but he is cheerful, and bears up bravely. Jacob<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> has
"come out" wonderfully. He is cool, active, and bold,
keeps his wits about him under fire, and does altogether
well. We are fortunate in having him with the force.
Good field-officers are very scarce indeed; I do not wonder
at people at a distance bewailing the delay in the
taking of Delhi. No one not on the spot can appreciate
the difficulties in the way, or the painful truth that those
difficulties increase upon us. The very large reinforcements
which the enemy are receiving, (the whole Bareilly
and Rohilcund force, some 5,000 men, are on their way
to join,) more than counterbalance the aid which can
reach us, so that when the last party arrives the odds
will still be immensely against us. It would not so much
signify if we could but get them into the open field, but
for every gun we can bring to bear upon them they can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
bring four heavier ones against us. We drive them before
us like chaff in the field, but they can and do attack
us in two or three quarters at once, and our unfortunate
soldiers are worked off their legs. I do not say this to
make matters look gloomy, for I am as confident as ever
of the result; but we may be a long while yet, and a
weary while too, before that result is arrived at. Baird
Smith will be here as Chief Engineer in a day or two,
and if we can manage to get some batteries made suddenly,
we may carry the city shortly; but there are great
obstacles. I regret more than ever that the assault was
not made on the night of the 11th, when they were unprepared
for us, and so much fewer in numbers. Now
they increase daily, and the city is so overflowing, that
the rascals are encamped outside the gates under cover
of their formidable batteries, and in the glacis; so much
for giving our arsenal into native keeping. All is well at
Agra; beyond that, we know nothing.</p>

<p><i>June 23d.</i>&mdash;The rebels came out again this morning
in considerable force, with the avowed intention of attacking
us on all sides. They have been frustrated, however,
save on one point, and firing is still going on. They do
little more than annoy us, and the only great evil they
cause, is the keeping our men out for hours in this scorching
heat. The worst of all is, that we can do but little
harm to them, as they are well under cover. The rascals
most forward to-day are the Jullundur troops, who ought
never to have been allowed to join the king of the rebels
here at Delhi; why they were not pursued and cut up, is
at present a mystery, but indignation is strong in camp
against those who suffered their escape.</p>

<p>General Johnstone has met with a serious accident at
Paneeput, I hear; most unfortunate indeed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span></p>

<p><i>June 23d.</i>&mdash;An amusing story is told <i>&agrave; propos</i> of the
fight this morning. A rascally Pandy, thinking all was
over, put his head out of the window of one of the houses,
in the shade of which a few Europeans and Goorkhas
were resting. One of the latter jumped up, laid hold of
the rebel by his hair, and with one chop of his "kookrie"
took off his head. Atkinson should make a sketch of
this for the <i>Illustrated News</i>. Sarel, of the 9th Lancers,
came in this morning, in an incredibly short space of
time, from his shooting expedition in the interior, ten
days' journey beyond Simla. He reports all quiet there,
thank God! I am sadly weak, I find, and have been
obliged to change my work from the saddle to the pen
more than once to-day. This want of physical strength
depresses me. It is a burden to me to stand or walk, and
the excessive heat makes it difficult for me to recover
from that sharp attack of illness. The doctors urge me
to go away for a little to get strength,&mdash;as if I could
leave just now, or as if I would if I could.</p>

<p><i>June 24th.</i>&mdash;I have been in the saddle nearly all day,
though obliged occasionally to rest a bit when I could
find shelter. One of my halts was by the side of Alfred
Light, who has behaved magnificently under trial and
difficulty. It does me good to see the "Light of the ballroom"
working away at his guns, begrimed with dust and
heat, ever cheery and cool, though dead beat from fatigue
and exposure. He is one of a thousand, and a host in
himself.</p>

<p>The enemy turned us out very early, and the firing
continued without intermission till dark, and such a day;
liquid fire was no name for the fervent heat. Colonel
Welchman got an ugly wound in the arm, and Dennis
was knocked down by the sun, and numbers of the men;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
but nothing less than a knock-down blow from sun, sword,
or bullet, stops a British soldier. How well they fought
to-day; and to do them justice, so did my old Guides and
my new Sikhs, while the little Goorkhas vied with any in
endurance and courage; but the mismanagement of matters
is perfectly sickening. Nothing the rebels can do
will equal the evils arising from incapacity and indecision.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Neville Chamberlain has arrived, and he
ought to be worth a thousand men to us. I can but remember
when Lord Dalhousie gave me the command
of the Guides, how anxious he was for me to exchange
it with him for the Military Secretaryship at Lahore.
Spite of all, I can never regret not having yielded, for I
feel that these two years of persecution and suffering
have been of service to me. I can truly say, it is good
for me to have been afflicted, and I am conscious of being
more fitted either for the Victoria Cross or the soldier's
grave! I do not think either that Chamberlain
bears me any ill-will, rather the contrary; but did he do
so, I would lose anything personally, for the sake of having
his influence predominant at head-quarters. I am
neither downhearted nor desponding when I say that
with our present chiefs I see no chance of taking Delhi.
It might have been done many days ago, (certes, it was
not for want of a distinct plan being before them or a
willing leader,) but they have not the nerve nor the heart
for a bold stroke requiring the smallest assumption of responsibility.
Horses are very scarce here, and I have the
greatest difficulty in getting my own men mounted. Mr.
Montgomery is helping me wonderfully with men, and I
receive offers for service daily, but in these mutinous
times it is necessary to be cautious. A telegraph from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
Agra says, "Heavy firing at Cawnpore: result not
known."</p>

<p><i>June 25th.</i>&mdash;There is little doing to-day, save a vain
fire of long shots, and I fear nothing effective will be
done till the 8th and 61st arrive. I hope much from
Chamberlain. The General, though one of the kindest
and best of men, has neither health nor nerve enough for
so responsible, and really very difficult, a position as that
he is now in. Our loss in officers and men bears a sadly
large proportion to our successes. In the 1st Fusileers it
is, too, melancholy: Colonel Welchman with a very bad
hit in the arm, in addition to his sickness when he came
to Delhi from Dugshai; Greville down with fever; Wriford
with dysentery; Dennis with sunstroke; Brown
with wounds. Jacob and the "boys" have all the work
to themselves, and well indeed do the boys behave, with
a courage and coolness that would not disgrace veterans.
Little Tommy Butler, Owen, Warner, all behave like
heroes, albeit with sadly diminishing numbers to lead. I
am vexed at the mistakes or falsehoods of the newspaper
reports. So far from having been wounded in the fight
of the 19th, I was not even present, but ill in bed. When
Colonel Becher came into camp wounded, I got up and
struggled into the saddle, and tried to get far enough to
send up fresh troops; but I had not got ten yards before
I fell from my horse, and was all but carried back to my
tent again.</p>

<p>I am more and more convinced that I was right not to
persist in my refusal to take again the command of the
Guides. It was so pressed on me, and surely the best
eradication of the reproach of removal was the being
asked to reassume it in times of difficulty and danger
like these.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span></p>

<p>That this is the general view of the case is shown by
the warm and hearty congratulations I meet with on all
sides. There is but one rule of action for a soldier in
the field, as for a man at all times: to do that which is
best for the public good; to make that your sole aim,
resting assured that the result will in the end be best
for individual interest also. I am quite indifferent not to
see my name appear in newspaper paragraphs and despatches;
only content if I can perform my duty truly
and honestly, and too thankful to the Almighty if I am
daily spared for future labors or future repose.</p>

<p>The story prevalent in the hills, that 7,000 of the
enemy are pitched in the open plain, is a mere magnification
of the simple fact, that a surplus portion of the
rebels have encamped under cover of their guns, and
close up under the wall of the city, and remain there all
night, but this is on the side opposite us. We are not
very well off, <i>quant &agrave; la cuisine</i>. I never had so much
trouble in getting anything fit to eat, except when I dine
with the General. Colonel Seaton<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> lives in my tent,
and is a great companion; his joyous disposition is a perpetual
rebuke to the croakers. Don't believe what is
said about our batteries doing no harm. The same was
said of Muttra, yet, when we entered, scarcely a square
yard was unploughed by our shot. One of the native
officers of the Guides (you know how ingenious they are
at disguise) got into the city as a spy, and remained
there four days. He reports great dissension and quarrelling
among themselves. Robbery and fighting and
everything that is bad, between the newly arrived rebels
and the city people. This account my own native newsletters
confirm. The 9th Native Infantry had already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
decamped, and thousands would follow if they dared.
This last, I doubt; the spirit of bravado, if not of bravery,
is as yet too strong. The rascals in the last engagement
came out in their red coats and medals!</p>

<p><i>June 26th.</i>&mdash;I have been so hard at work the whole
day, that I can only find time to say the enemy has made
no sortie to-day, but Pandy amuses himself with firing
long shots incessantly; all well, however.</p>

<p><i>27th.</i>&mdash;We were turned out before I had hardly
turned in, by another attack of the rebels. This time a
faint one, which has been already repulsed with trifling
loss on our side. For a short time, however, the cannonade
was very heavy, and I have seldom been under a
hotter fire than for about three quarters of an hour at our
most advanced battery, covered every moment with showers,
or rather clouds, of dust, stones, and splinters; but
we kept close, and no one was hurt. There has been an
outcry throughout camp at &mdash;&mdash;'s having fled from Bh&aacute;gput,
the bridge which caused me so much hard riding
and hard work to get, some time ago. A report came
that a portion of the mutineers were moving in that direction,
and he fairly bolted, leaving boats, bridge, and all!
Yet he had with him all the Rajah of Jheend's men,
horse, foot, and guns, and never even saw the twinkle of
a musket. In fact, it is not at all sure that an enemy
was ever near him. By this conduct he has not only cut
us off from all communication with Meerut, but actually
left the boats to be used or destroyed by the enemy.
Our reinforcements are in sight, at least the camp of the
8th, and I do trust no further delay will take place in our
getting possession of Delhi. The insurgents are disheartened,
and I have no doubt but that the moment we
get possession of a single gate the greater portion of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
will run out through the opposite ones. The only formidable
part of the enemy is their artillery, which is
amazingly well-served, and in prodigious abundance, as
my experience this morning abundantly proved. Harris,
of the 2d European Bengal Fusileers, was wounded
this morning, but not dangerously. All quiet at Agra,
we believe, but no particulars known.</p>

<p><i>June 28th.</i>&mdash;I have just got orders to proceed to
Bh&aacute;gput, some twenty-five miles off, on the Jumna, and
see what the real state of affairs is, and try to save the
boats, so I have only time to say I am much better and
stronger, which is a great comfort, for I could not have
ridden the distance, a few days ago. The rains have begun,
and the air is colder and more refreshing, though
not exactly what one could wish. Certainly the hot season
in India is not the pleasantest time in the year for
campaigning, and this the rascally mutineers were fully
aware of before they began. Colonel Greathed and the
8th came in this morning, and the 61st will be here to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>June 29th.</i>&mdash;I was thirteen hours and a half in the
saddle without intermission yesterday, and got back to
camp after midnight, very tired, but none the worse;
fortunately, I had a cloudy day and a tolerably cool
breeze for my work. I recovered the boats and found
all quiet, in spite of &mdash;&mdash;'s disgraceful flight. He had
not even the sense or courage to draw the boats over to
our side of the river, consequently, three were burnt and
the whole place plundered. So much for acting on
native reports, without at least attempting to ascertain
their accuracy. The consequences are bad and discreditable
to a degree.</p>

<p>I doubt whether General Barnard used the exact expression
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
reported regarding Tombs, but he did say, and
well he might, that he was as gallant and good a soldier
as any in camp, and so indeed he is.</p>

<p>The fight of the 23d was a much more severe one than
was reported. It was not over till dark, and our loss
was the heaviest we have yet had to deplore, since we
got here on the 8th.</p>

<p>Reports must not be depended on. The fact was,
Major Olpherts arrived early in the morning. I myself
galloped out to meet him, and as he passed, when the
fight had just commenced, he fired once at the enemy, and
then came into camp to rest his men after their long
march. We were out the whole day until dark, and half
dead with fatigue. Colonel Welchman suffers severely
from his wound, but bears it bravely, as does Peter
Brown.</p>

<p>Everything quiet to-day, no firing on either side. I
do hope this part of the business will soon be over, and
that they will only wait for the 61st and Coke's regiment,
both of which will be here to-morrow or next day. Colonel
Seaton himself recommended the disarming of his
old Corps, the 35th Native Infantry. To-day we hear it
has been done. All was safe at Cawnpore and Lucknow
up to our last news.</p>

<p><i>July 2d.</i>&mdash;I have been quite unable to write since the
29th, on the night of which I was ordered off again to
Bh&aacute;gput, to try to bring the boats down to camp, either
to make a bridge here or a "stop" for the enemy. The
order was given with the complimentary addenda from
the General, "because I can trust your judgment quite as
much as your energy." I expected to be back in good
time on the 30th, but the winds and waves were against
me, and I could not get my fleet of boats down the river.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span></p>

<p>Shebbeare was with me, and we worked like a couple
of "navvies," passing the two days and one night on the
banks of the river, without shelter, and almost without
food, for we had nothing but a couple of "chupatties,"
each, and a small tin of soup and a little tea, which I
fortunately took with me. Poor Shebbeare would soon
lose the graceful rotund of his figure if he were long on
such short commons, but I do not think any amount of
starvation could reduce my horizontal dimensions.</p>

<p>All's well that ends well, however, and I succeeded in
getting every boat safe into camp last night. I missed
the skirmish of the 30th by being at Bh&aacute;gput. The 61st
have arrived, rich in twenty officers. We are getting
more supplies now, and I have set myself up with plates
and dishes for the small charge of one rupee. Colonel
Seaton's traps and servants will be here to-day, and then
we shall be comfortable, for hitherto a very limited allowance
for one has been but small accommodation for two.
For my new regiment two complete troops are on their
way from Lahore and will be here on the 8th, and another
troop from Jugraon should be here in a week. Two
more troops are preparing at Lahore.</p>

<p>Montgomery takes the most kind interest in my new
Corps, and I am rejoiced and comforted to find that he
cordially approves of my having accepted the Guides. I
have as much confidence in his judgment as in his kindness.
&mdash;&mdash; has been shelved, and allowed to get "sick"
to save him from supersession. I do not like euphuisms.
In these days men and things should be called by their
right names, that we might know how far either should be
trusted.</p>

<p>Sir E. Campbell arrived here to-day by mail-cart, and
will be a valuable addition to the 60th, or he will belie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
his descent from the Bourbons and Fitzgeralds. He is a
man you can always trust, which is saying something in
these hard times.</p>

<p><i>July 3d.</i>&mdash;Whatever I may have sacrificed of pride
and personal feeling to a sense of duty, I shall be fully
rewarded by entering Delhi at the head of the Guides.
Here at least there is but one opinion on the subject.
My poor gallant Guides! they have suffered severely for
their fidelity to our cause, above a fourth of the whole
having been killed or wounded, including some of our
best men. Koor Singh, the little Goorkha Subadar who
won the Order of Merit in that stiff affair at Boree in
'53, is gone, and others whom we could ill afford to lose,
now that so much depends on the fidelity of the native
officers,&mdash;the Guides more than all. Surely, then, I am
right, knowing and feeling that my influence with them is
so great, to sink every personal consideration before the
one great end of public safety, which implies that of ourselves
and those dear to us. If we fail here at Delhi,
not a soul in the Punjaub or Upper Provinces would be
safe for a day.</p>

<p><i>July 5th.</i>&mdash;It was impossible for me to write by yesterday's
d&acirc;k, for the rebels got into our rear during the
night of the 3d, and attacked Alipoor, the first stage from
hence on the Kurn&acirc;l road. I was out reconnoitring, and
saw them moving out some five miles on our right. I
reported their position at 7 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> on the 3d, but not until
3 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> of the 4th were any measures taken, by which
time, of course, they had attained their end, and were
in full march back to Delhi. At daybreak yesterday I
pointed out their exact whereabouts to Coke, (who commanded
the party sent to attack them,) and I did not get
back to camp till 8 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>; a hard day's work, especially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
as I had no breakfast, nor indeed food of any kind, and
hunger makes the heat tell.</p>

<p>We beat 5,000 of the rebels in the morning, and were
twice attacked by upwards of 3,000 in the course of the
day. I took the Guides in pursuit (as soon as our guns
had driven the enemy from their position), and drove
them into a village. Unfortunately we did not do half as
well as we ought, for though Coke is a good commandant
of a regiment, and a good man for the frontiers, he is no
general, and did not manage well, or we should have cut
up numbers of the enemy and taken their guns.</p>

<p>Our loss was about thirty or forty Europeans, and three
of my native officers temporarily disabled. Both men
and horses were terribly knocked up towards the end of
the day, and could hardly crawl back to camp, and no
wonder. I was mercifully preserved, though I am sorry
to say my gallant "Feroza" was badly wounded twice
with sabre cuts, and part of his bridle cut through, and
a piece of my glove shaved off, so it was rather close
work. My men, who were most engaged of all, escaped
with the loss of one killed and six wounded, and six
horses put <i>hors de combat</i>. I am dissatisfied with the
day's work, inasmuch as more might have been done, and
what was done is only satisfactory as a proof of the ease
with which Anglo-Saxons can thrash Asiatics at any odds.
Yesterday they were at least from ten to fifteen to one
against us. To-day General Barnard has been attacked
with cholera, I grieve to say; and Colonel Welchman is
very ill indeed. The doctors dread erysipelas, which at
his age would be serious; beyond this, the wounded are
generally doing well.</p>

<p><i>July 6th.</i>&mdash;Poor General Barnard died last night, and
was buried this morning. He sank rapidly, for anxiety,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
worry, over-exertion, and heat had prepared his system,
and it was impossible for him to bear up against the virulence
of cholera. Personally, I am much grieved, for no
kinder or more considerate or more gentlemanly man
ever lived. I am so sorry for his son, a fine brave fellow,
whose attention to his father won the love of us all. It
was quite beautiful to see them together.</p>

<p>I have just seen a copy of a very strong minute anent
the Bh&aacute;gput affair, which shows the General was not disposed
to pass it over lightly. The civil authorities, however,
are determined to support &mdash;&mdash;, though in camp
there is but one opinion of his conduct. The present
state of things is terrible, enough to fret one to death,&mdash;no
head, no brains, no decision. Neville Chamberlain,
though of decided excellence as a man of action, is, I
begin to fear, but a poor man of business. Prompt decision
in council is what we want; there is no lack of
vigorous action. There are plenty to obey; but we want
some one to command. We have seen nothing of the
enemy outside the walls since the 4th. I am worked off
my legs all the same, and the day is not half long enough
for what I have to do. To make matters worse, too, poor
Macdowell is down with fever: a sad loss just now to
"Hodson's Horse," as they call my growing corps. I
am sadly off for clothes, as we of course are only too
glad to help the poor refugees who come into camp with
none.</p>

<p><i>July 8th.</i>&mdash;We left camp at 2 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> with a considerable
force, and marched to a bridge some ten miles off,
which we blew up to prevent the enemy annoying us,
and then marched back again. I tried hard to induce
Chamberlain, who commanded, to march back by another
road, which I had reconnoitred, and which would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
brought us close along the rear and flank of the enemy,
but he would not do so, though admitting that I was right.
We have had eleven hours in the saddle and in the sun,
merely for this trifling gain. My face is like "General
Gascoigne's," and my hands perfectly skinless. I must
get some dogskin gloves, for it is as much as I can do
to hold a sword, much less a pen. There has been no
fighting since the 4th, and my news-writers from the
city speak of much disheartenment, and symptoms of a
break-up; but I doubt this latter being more than a
report, while the enemy are so well provided both with
"<i>mat&eacute;riel</i>" and "<i>personnel</i>."</p>

<p>I have just returned from a long chase after a party
of the enemy's horse, safe and unhurt, but drenched to
the skin by a cataract of rain. There has been some
hard fighting to-day. The 8th Irregulars from Bareilly
came into our camp, thanks to the defection of a party
of the 9th Irregular Cavalry, who were on picket duty.
The rascals consequently were enabled to get into our
very lines, and cut down one officer at his guns. There
was a tremendous row and confusion for a short time, but
we soon put it to rights. I had warned the authorities
repeatedly, that the Irregulars were not to be trusted, but
they were too fainthearted or "merciful" (Heaven forgive
me for using such a word about such villains) to disarm
them, and both the regiments, about which I reported,
have since gone wrong.</p>

<p><i>July 10th.</i>&mdash;We are nearly flooded out of camp by
the rain, and everything is wet and wretched but ourselves.
I have no respite from work, however, and have
only time to say that the ladies in the hills could not employ
themselves better or in a greater work of charity
than in making flannel shirts for the soldiers, for our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
stores are either in the enemy's hands or not come-at-able.
The soldiers bear up like men, but the constant
state of wet is no small addition to what they have to
endure from heat, hard work, and hard fighting. I
know by experience what a comfort a dry flannel shirt
is.</p>

<p>There is a sad joke against me in camp, and I cannot
help joining in the laugh against myself, though enraged
at having been the victim of such a sell. Fancy my
riding up to a party of horse, and asking who they were,
being told they were our own men, 9th Irregulars, and
then marching parallel to them for three miles, and not
three quarters of a mile apart, when, had I known who
they were, I could have destroyed every man.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Mr.
Saunders arrived in camp to-day, looking as fat and well
as possible, though he and his pretty wife had a narrow
escape and hard day's riding from Moradabad.</p>

<p><i>July 11th.</i>&mdash;Pen-work again all day, as the enemy
seem to prefer keeping under cover from the rain.</p>

<p>Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s story is so far true, that I did earnestly
urge the construction of a bridge with the boats I brought
down from Bh&aacute;gput, but without success. There are
difficulties, I admit, and great ones, but I humbly think
they might be overcome now, as they certainly could
three weeks ago, when our plan of assault was suggested,
and adopted by General Barnard. There is a sad outcry
in camp against Chamberlain for having used his influence
to prevent the disarming of what remains of the
9th Irregulars. Numbers of them had deserted, and one
native officer, and those who were on picket duty, actually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
admitted a party of the enemy into our camp; and yet,
forsooth, because they were Chamberlain's regiment once
on a time, the order to disarm them, which the General
had actually issued, was cancelled. I confess I expected
better things than this weakness, when our very lives depend
on firmness and decision. Light has just come in
off duty, so begrimed with smoke and powder as scarcely
to be distinguished even by his own men. He is admitted
to be one of the best of our officers, and certainly one
of the hardest working. Tombs always distinguishes
himself.</p>

<p><i>July 12th.</i>&mdash;300 of my new regiment have just
arrived. 100 more left Lahore on the 7th, and 100 will
be here very soon from the Sutlej. Mr. Montgomery
has done me most essential service, as I could never by
myself (with another regiment to command, and so much
pen-work to do) have got so many men together; and
everything he does is so complete. He sends figured
statements giving all details regarding men and horses,
(these last are very difficult to get,) which will save me
much time and labor hereafter. He has been really
most kind, and has, moreover, during this troublous time,
evinced an energy, decision, and vigor for which I believe
the world hardly gave him credit. For officers, I hope to
have permanently, Macdowell, Shebbeare, (now acting as
my 2d in command of the Guides, and a most excellent
officer,) and Hugh Gough of the 3d Cavalry. Saunders
made &mdash;&mdash;'s removal a "sine qua non" before he would
take charge of the district. He came to me to recommend
a good officer to command the Jheend troops. I
named that merry grig, George Hall, who is, I believe,
available, and a really good soldier. I have got a very
nice lad "pro tem." in the Guides, young Craigie, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
promises very well indeed. I have seven officers attached
to the Guides, but two are wounded, and Chalmers
is very ill. Young Ellis of the 1st Fusileers is
down with cholera, poor boy; and Colonel Welchman
dangerously ill and in great agony. I grieve deeply for
the brave old man, for I fear we shall lose him.</p>

<p><i>July 13th.</i>&mdash;We have had news from Agra to-day up
to the 7th. The Neemuch rebels and others approached
Agra from the south. The 3d Europeans and D'Oyley's
Battery went out to meet them with the Kotah Contingent.
The Contingent turned against us as soon as they
came in sight of the enemy. A fight ensued, in which
the mutineers got well beaten, despite the treachery and
great disparity of numbers; two of their guns were
taken. On our side we lost one gun, the tumbrels having
been blown up and the horses killed. All our men's
ammunition was expended, and they had to retire in good
order into the fort. D'Oyley was killed and two officers
wounded. Thirty casualties in all. The mutineers then
rushed into cantonments, which they burnt and pillaged;
then broke open the great jail and released the prisoners.
They did not venture near the fort, but marched off
towards Muttra, and will, I suppose, come here. The
delay here is sickening; if it continues much longer, we
shall be too weak-handed to attempt to take the place
until fresh regiments arrive.</p>

<p>I inspected my three new troops this morning; very
fine-looking fellows, most of them. I am getting quite a
little army under me, what with the Guides and my own
men. Would to Heaven they would give us something
more to do than this desultory warfare, which destroys
our best men, and brings us no whit nearer Delhi, and
removes the end of the campaign to an indefinite period.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>
<i>July 14th.</i>&mdash;Only time<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> to say I am again mercifully
preserved, safe and unhurt, after one of the sharpest
encounters we have yet had. Shebbeare got wounded
early in the fight, so I led the Guide Infantry myself in
the skirmish of the villages and suburbs. I charged
the guns with some eight horsemen, a party of the Guide
Infantry and 1st Fusileers. We got within thirty yards,
but the enemy's grape was too much for our small party.
Three of my officers, Shebbeare, Hawes, and De Brett,
slightly wounded, and several men; but though well to
the front, my party suffered proportionably least.</p>

<p>Of the Fusileers, who were with us, some sixty men
were wounded; Daniell's arm broken by a shot, Jacob's
horse shot dead under him, Chamberlain shot through the
arm, little Roberts wounded, and several more.</p>

<p>Everybody wonders I was not hit; none more than
myself. God has been very merciful to me. Colonel
Welchman better; Brown also. More particulars hereafter.</p>

<p><i>July 15th.</i>&mdash;I could only write a few words last night
on my return from the fight, worn out as I was with a
severe day's work. It is pretty much the same now,
and while I write I am obliged to have two men to keep
the candle alight with their hands, for the breeze gets up
at night, and we have all the "Kanats" of the tents
down to enable us to breathe; and having no shades to
the candlesticks, it is rather difficult to write even that I
am safe.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>
<i>July 16th.</i>&mdash;I have just bade good-bye to Colonel
Welchman. The poor old man is better, but sadly pulled
down and aged. The doctors now think his arm may be
saved, that it may remain on, but it will never be of the
slightest use to him again, the elbow-joint is so much
injured. He and Captain Brown start to-morrow night,
with a convoy of sick and wounded men and officers, for
Umb&acirc;la and the hills. Of these, the 1st Fusileers form
a sad proportion. With one or two exceptions, nothing
could be better or more gallant than the conduct of this
regiment. Jacob, Greville, Wriford, all admirable in the
field, and the younger officers beyond all praise; Butler,
F. Brown, Owen, and Warner, markedly so. In all the
worst of the awful heat, dust, fatigue, work, and privation,&mdash;and
all have been beyond description,&mdash;our plucky
fellows have not only kept up their own spirits, but been
an example and pattern to the camp. If any one was
down in his luck, he had only to go to the Fusileers'
mess and be jolly.</p>

<p>The story in the papers about the boot was essentially
correct for once, though how they should have got hold
of it I do not know, for I never mentioned it even to
you, since it certainly could not be called a wound, though
a very narrow escape from one. A rascally Pandy
made a thrust at my horse, which I parried, when he
seized his "tulwar" in both hands, bringing it down like
a sledge-hammer; it caught on the iron of my antigropelos
legging, which it broke into the skin, cut through the
stirrup-leather, and took a slice off my boot and stocking;
and yet, wonderful to say, the sword did not penetrate
the skin. Both my horse and myself were staggered
by the force of the blow, but I recovered myself quickly,
and I don't think that Pandy will ever raise his "tulwar"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
again. I should not have entered into all these details
about self but for those tiresome papers having made so
much of it. The fight on that day (the 14th) was the
old story. An attack in force on the right of our position;
the enemy were allowed to blaze away, expending
powder, and doing us no harm, until 4 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>, when a column
was sent down to turn them out of the gardens and
villages they had occupied, and drive them back to the
city. I had just returned from a long day's work with
the cavalry, miles away in the rear, and had come back
as far as Light's advanced battery. I was chatting with
him for a few minutes <i>en passant</i>, when I saw the column
pass down. I joined it, and sent for a few horsemen to
accompany me, and when we got under fire, I found the
Guide Infantry, under Shebbeare, had been sent to join
in the attack. I accompanied them, and while the Fusileers
and Coke's men were driving the mass of the enemy
helter-skelter through the gardens to our right, I went,
with the Guides, Goorkhas, and part of the Fusileers,
along the Grand Trunk Road leading right into the gates
of Delhi. We were exposed to a heavy fire of grape
from the walls, and musketry from behind trees and
rocks; but pushing on, we drove them right up to the
very walls, killing uncounted numbers, and then were
ordered to retire. This was done too quickly by the
artillery, and some confusion ensued, the troops hurrying
back too fast. The consequence was, the enemy rallied,
bringing up infantry, then a large body of cavalry, and
behind them again two guns to bear on us. There were
very few of our men, but I managed to get eight horsemen
to the front. Shebbeare, though wounded, aided
me in rallying some Guide Infantry, and Greville and
Jacob (whose horse had just been shot) coming up,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
brought a few scattered Fusileers forward. I called on
the men to fire, assuring them that the body of cavalry
coming down would never stand. I got a few men to
open fire; my gallant Guides stood their ground like
men; Shebbeare, Jacob, Greville, and little Butler, came
to the front, and the mass of the enemy's cavalry, just as
I said, stopped, reeled, turned, and fled in confusion; the
guns behind them were for the moment deserted, and I
tried hard to get up a charge to capture them; we were
within thirty paces; twenty-five resolute men would
have been enough; but the soldiers were blown, and
could not push on in the face of such odds, unsupported
as we were, for the whole of the rest of the troops had
retired. My eight horsemen stood their ground, and the
little knot of officers used every exertion to aid us, when
suddenly two rascals rushed forward with lighted port-fires
in their hands, fired the guns, loaded with grape, in our
faces, and when the smoke cleared away, we found, to
our infinite disgust and chagrin, that they had limbered
up the guns and were off at a gallop. We had then to
effect our retreat to rejoin the column, under a heavy fire
of grape and musketry, and many men and officers were
hit in doing it. I managed to get the Guides to retire
quietly, fighting as they went, and fairly checking the
enemy, on which I galloped back and brought up two
guns, when we soon stopped all opposition, and drove the
last living rebel into his Pandemonium. My Guides
stood firm, and, as well as my new men, behaved admirably;
not so all who were engaged, and it was in consequence
of that poor Chamberlain got wounded; for seeing
a hesitation among the troops he led, who did not like
the look of a wall lined with Pandies, and stopped short
instead of going up to it, he leaped his horse clean over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
the wall into the midst of them, and dared the men to
follow, which they did, but he got a ball in the shoulder.
There is not a braver heart or cooler head in camp; his
fault is too great hardihood and exposure in the field and
a sometimes too injudicious indifference to his own life,
or that of his men. We are in a nice fix here; General
Reed is so ill he is ordered away at once; Chamberlain
is on his back for six weeks at least; Norman, however,
is safe and doing admirably; were he to be hit, the
"head-quarters" would break down altogether. There
will be no assault on Delhi yet; our rulers will now less
than ever decide on a bold course; and truth to tell, the
numbers of the enemy have so rapidly increased, and
ours have been so little replenished in proportion, and
our losses, for a small army, have been so severe, that it
becomes a question, whether now we have numbers sufficient
to risk an assault. Would to Heaven it had been
tried when I first pressed it. How many brave hearts
have been sacrificed in consequence. Coke's men suffered
severely on the 14th from getting too close, yet not close
enough, to the city walls.</p>

<p><i>July 17th.</i>&mdash;But little private writing for me to-day,
as I have only just come back from Brigadier Hope
Grant's tent, whither I went on business, and I have
been fully occupied with news-writers <i>cum multis aliis</i>. I
begin to think of giving up this Quartermaster-General's
work, now that times are so changed. I began with poor
General Anson, "under his Excellency's personal orders;"
I continued this work under General Barnard at
his request, and now for these last days under General
Reed; but he too is incapacitated by sickness, age, and
anxiety, and goes off to the hills to-night. Colonel Curzon
left for Simla yesterday. Colonel Congreve also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
goes, so the head-quarters of the army are finally breaking
up. The Adjutant-General (Chamberlain) is badly
wounded, the Quartermaster-General (Colonel Becher)
ditto, though he does work a little in-doors, if one may
use such an expression of a tent, but he ought not to do
even that much, so badly hurt as he is. Colonel Young,
Norman, and myself are therefore the only representatives
of the head-quarter staff, except the doctors and
commissaries. The head-quarters of the army are now
at Calcutta, General Pat Grant's arrival having been
announced, and this army has dropped into merely a field
force, commanded by Brigadier Wilson as senior, with
the rank of Brigadier-General. I can hardly reconcile
myself to throw up the Intelligence Department now that
I have had the trouble of getting it into working order;
but for my own sake I must do so, for it is a terrible drag
on me, and ties me down too much. I am wonderfully
well, thank God! and able to get through as much work
as any man; but commanding two regiments, and being
eyes and ears of the army too, is really too much! Shebbeare
and Macdowell are appointed to my regiment in
general orders&mdash;the former as second in command, but
to continue for the present with the Guides; the latter as
adjutant, but to act as second in command also, for the
present. I hope to have another officer or two in a few
days, as more now devolves on poor Mac than his fragile
frame can well stand. I wish his bodily strength was
equal to his will and courage. It is hot, oh, how hot!
and we can have nothing but a hand punkah occasionally;
if our servants were to make off, we should indeed be in
a pretty predicament, but hitherto they have been faithful
and unmurmuring.</p>

<p><i>July 19th.</i>&mdash;I was quite unable to write yesterday, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
I went out long before daylight; so with the exception of
a few minutes at 8 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> I was in the saddle until dark!
We had a smart engagement in the afternoon. I was
sent for to take the Guide cavalry down into the suburbs
to support some guns, and assist in driving the enemy
back into the city. We were commanded by a fine old
gentleman, who might sit for a portrait of Falstaff, so fat
and jolly is he: Colonel Jones, of the 60th Rifles. We
got down to our point, close to the walls of Delhi, easily
enough, the rascally enemy being ready enough to turn
and fly for shelter; but to return was the difficulty; the
instant we began to draw off, they followed us, their immense
numbers giving them a great power of annoyance
at very slight cost to themselves. The brave old colonel
was going to retire "all of a heap," infantry, guns, and
all in a helpless mass, and we should have suffered cruel
loss in those narrow roads, with walls and buildings on
both sides. I rode up to him and pointed this out, and in
reply received <i>carte blanche</i> to act as I saw best. This
was soon done, with the assistance of Henry Vicars
(Adjutant 61st) and Coghill, (Adjutant 2d Bengal European
Fusileers,) both cool soldiers under fire, though so
young, and we got off in good order and with trifling loss,
drawing the men back slowly and in regular order,
covered by Dixon's and Money's guns. My own men,
whose duty was the difficult one of enduring a very hot
fire without acting, behaved admirably, and I had the
satisfaction of losing only one killed and two wounded,
besides a few horses, who generally come off second best
where bullets are flying about. My poor "Feroza" was
hit by one, but not dangerously, and I was again most mercifully
preserved unharmed. I was out again early this
morning reconnoitring, and have only just returned in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
time to write even so much, too much of myself as usual
for my own feeling, but you will have it so<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>.</p>

<p><i>July 20th.</i>&mdash;I had a very fatiguing, because sunshiny,
ride yesterday, and a troublesome species of <i>reconnaissance</i>,
to prevent the enemy getting into our rear. Their
name is indeed "legion" compared with us. I should
say, from all I can ascertain by the news-letters, that
there cannot be less than 36,000<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> fighting men in Delhi,
while we are barely a fifth of that number, including cavalry
and all! Our position, however, is much strengthened,
and we now beat them with half the trouble we had
at first, their appetite for fighting being considerably lessened
by having been so repeatedly driven back; but
alas! we only drive them back, while we do not advance
an inch. The odds have, moreover, fearfully increased
against us by their continued accessions, and I confess I
now see less and less hope of success in an assault; when
I first urged it, the enemy had not more than 7,000
Sepoys in the city, while we had 2,000 infantry alone.
Now, as I said before, the case is very different; for even
were we to undertake an assault with a reasonable prospect
of success, if they should, in despair, determine to defend
the city inch by inch, or street by street, we should
not have men enough to secure our hold upon it. In that
case, the city people (all of whom are armed) would join
in the fray, and, considering what the consequences of
failure would be, and further, that to do this much we
should be obliged to use up every man available, leaving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
no one, or next to none, to protect our camp, sick, and
wounded, from any attempt of the enemy, or of our questionable
friends, the country people, it becomes a matter
of serious and painful consideration. A want of success,
moreover, would now be productive of infinite mischief.
From hence to Allahabad, the fort of Agra and the
Residency of Lucknow are the only spots where the
British flag still flies. We are more to be considered now
as an isolated band, fighting for our very name and existence
in the midst of an enemy's country, than as an avenging
army about to punish a rebel force. Sir H. Lawrence
is holding out at Lucknow, but Cawnpore has fallen
into the hands of the rebels. Sir Hugh Wheeler, after
three weeks' contest, with, we hear, only 150 Europeans,
in an evil hour capitulated, on condition of being provided
with boats and a free passage to Allahabad; as
soon as they were on board the boats, the whole were
massacred! What became of the women and children
we know not; it is hoped they might have been sent away
earlier and escaped; otherwise it is horrible to think of
what may have been their fate. Troops are collecting
fast at Allahabad, and I hope moving on towards Cawnpore;
some think we shall be forced to await their arrival
at or near Delhi, before we can do anything effective.
I trust earnestly that the city will not hold out so long.
The people within it are immensely disheartened, and
dissensions are rife among them. A split between the
Hindoos and fanatic Mahommedans is almost inevitable,
and, above all, money is getting scarce. Meantime, this
"waiting race" is very wearying to heart and body.</p>

<p>... I have determined on giving up the Assistant
Quartermaster-Generalship. It gives me more work
than I really can manage in such weather, in addition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
to the command of two regiments. Macdowell promises
admirably, and I trust there is every hope of our having
a nice body of officers with "Hodson's Horse." Nothing
further from Agra, beyond the assurance that all was
well there.</p>

<p><i>July 21st.</i>&mdash;Just returned from a long <i>reconnaissance</i>,
and the post going out, so I have time but for little. Do
not believe what the idle gossips say, of my "doing the
work of two or three men." I strive to do my duty, but
I cannot consider I do more. I do not run wanton risks,
but I cannot stand by and see what ought to be done,
without risking something to do it. Had I not attempted
what I did on the 14th, even with the insufficient means
at my command, we should have been exposed to a disastrous
loss of life, and to the discredit of a reverse.
That we cannot afford. It is not only the possession of
India which is at stake, not only our name and fame as
Englishmen, but the safety, life, and honor of those nearest
and dearest to us; were we to fail here, the horrible
scenes of Meerut, Delhi, Rohilcund, Jhansee, and others,
would be repeated in the Punjaub and hill stations. Who,
then, as husband, brother, father, son, would hesitate to
face any danger, any risk, which tended to secure victory?
I saw that our men were retiring (by order) in
great confusion, that five minutes more and the whole
party would be destroyed, and the fate of the column
sealed, for the enemy's cavalry and guns were opening
on us at speed. It was a natural impulse to rush forward,
and nobly was I aided by Jacob and Greville, and
my handful of gallant Guides; the tide was turned by
the suddenness of the act; the enemy were driven back,
and our men had time to breathe. This was not much
to do, but it was a great deal to gain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span></p>

<p><i>July 22d.</i>&mdash;Again but a few lines, for I have been
regularly hunted all day. I told you that Sir H.
Wheeler had capitulated, and been treacherously destroyed
with his party; we have since heard that a force
from Allahabad had reached Cawnpore under Colonel
Neill of the Madras Fusileers, that Sir H. Lawrence has
been succored, and that, in point of fact, our power up
to Agra had been reestablished. God grant this be true.
Agra is safe, and all well; the troops which attacked it
are afraid to come on here, and have halted at Muttra.
The force in Delhi is much disheartened, and fights with
gradually decaying energy. Already we have beaten
them back in twenty-three fights, besides a few such affairs
on my own private account, and though with considerable
loss to us, yet with comparative ease, when you
consider their overwhelming numbers. We had an engagement
on the evening of the 20th, in which Colonel
Seaton commanded our column, the 1st Fusileers, 61st
Foot, and Guides as usual. I had command of the
Guide infantry, and led the advance as well as covered
the retreat; and though we pushed close up to Delhi,
we never had a shot fired from the walls until we had
set out on our return to camp some way. They then
came howling after us like jackals, but the Guides were
mindful of their old leader's voice, and steadily kept
them in check during the whole distance, so completely,
that not a European soldier was under fire, and I only lost
four men slightly wounded, while the enemy returned in
utter discomfiture. Poor Light has been very ill, and
Thompson has a bullet through his leg. Bishop also is
wounded; he retains the same calm composure of manner
under the hottest fire and hardest work, as he habitually
exhibited on the Mall. These are excellent officers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
but Tombs and Light are really splendid. I hope Chamberlain's
arm will be saved; he is a noble fellow, but of
course has his weaknesses.</p>

<p><i>July 24th.</i>&mdash;I was quite unable to write yesterday.
Pandy chose an unusually inconvenient hour for his attack,
and kept us out until the afternoon, and then I was
busied in attending to our poor friend Colonel Seaton,
who, I grieve to say, was badly wounded, a musket-ball
having entered his left breast and come out at his back,
providentially passing outside the ribs instead of through
his body; his lungs are, however, slightly injured, either
by a broken rib or the concussion, and until it is ascertained
to what extent this has gone, he is considered in
danger. I do not myself think there is danger, as no
unfavorable symptom has yet appeared, except a slight
spitting of blood; but he is so patient and quiet that all
is in his favor. I am deeply sorry for him, dear fellow!
and fervently pray that he may be spared to us. There
was little actual fighting; the rascals ran, the instant they
came in contact with our men; the only firing being behind
banks and garden-walls. Colonel Drought, late
60th Native Infantry, was wounded; Captain Money of
the Artillery got a bad knock on the knee-joint, and Law
of the 10th Native Infantry killed; two killed and five
wounded in the 1st Fusileers, who, as usual, bore the
brunt. After many discussions pro and con, it has been
arranged that I retain the Intelligence Department and
give up the Guides. My own men require great attention,
as they are now in considerable numbers; so the
General has begged me to relinquish the Guides instead
of the Assistant Quartermaster-Generalship; the command
of two regiments being an anomaly. I am very
ready to do this, though I regret the separation from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
men, and should have liked to have led my old corps into
Delhi; but it is best as it is. You at least will rejoice
that it greatly diminishes the risk to life and limb, which,
I confess, lately has been excessive in my case. The
General was very complimentary on my doings while
commanding the Guides, and "trusted to receive equally
invaluable services from my new regiment." I have
little doubt of this, if I am spared. I find General Barnard
reported no less than four times on my doings in the
highest terms; and the last public letter he ever wrote
was a special despatch to Government in my favor. It
was, in fact, the only letter of the kind he ever wrote,
for death intervened just as he was setting to work to
bring those who had done well to the notice of Government.</p>

<p>They tell me I shall get pay for the Assistant Quarter-master-General's
Department,<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> as well as my command
allowance. For the Guides, of course I shall get nothing;
but, I must say, I work, not like a "nigger," considering
their work usually amounts to <i>nil</i>, but like a
slave, in the Intelligence Department. I have been
deeply shocked to hear that poor Christian, his young
wife, and babes were among the murdered in Oudh.
Also Colonel Goldney.... All is well at Agra; there
are about 6,000 individuals in the fort, with provisions for
six months; they are probably relieved by now, for we
hear that six English regiments were at Cawnpore on
the 11th instant. This cheers up the men, and makes
them think that Government has some thought for the
gallant fellows here and elsewhere. I sent by Martin,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
of the 75th, a parcel for Mrs. Hallifax, containing, with
other things, the old pistol her poor husband gave me.
I should have liked to have kept it as a memorial of him,
but as she wished for it, of course I resign it; the other
arms, except the revolver, which Dr. Stewart says he
lost, were packed up and sent to Umb&acirc;la with other
things.</p>

<p><i>July 25th.</i>&mdash;Well, yes, I did offer to go down the
Do&acirc;b towards Agra and Cawnpore, to open the communication,
and ascertain exactly where the reinforcements
were, and assist them with cavalry in coming up
towards Delhi. It would have been of real use, and not
so dangerous as this eternal potting work here. I proposed
to take 600 of my Horse, 250 infantry of the
Guides, and four guns; could I not have made my way
with these? I humbly opine I could. I do not mean
to say it was not a bold stroke, but in Indian warfare I
have always found "toujours l'audace" not a bad motto.
I can never forget how much we have at stake, that we
have a continent in arms against us; and I do think (and
certainly shall always act so) that every man should do
not only his duty but his utmost in a crisis like the
present.</p>

<p><i>July 26th.</i>&mdash;A parcel with flannel shirts, &amp;c., arrived
last night. Those for the men I sent off to the hospital
at once, to the doctors' great delight. Macdowell declares
that the cap, his "jumpers," and the "baccy"
Lord W. Hay was to send, must be in the box, and demands
them imperiously. He is doing admirably, and
promises to be a first-rate officer of light horse. He
rides well, which is one good thing, and is brave as a
lion's whelp, which is another. I only fear whether he
has physical strength for such work in such weather.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
The whole country is a steaming bog. I keep my health
wonderfully, thank God! in spite of heat, hard work,
and exposure; and the men bear up like Britons. We
all feel that Government ought to allow every officer and
man before Delhi to count every month spent here as a
year of service in India. There is much that is disappointing
and disgusting to a man who feels that more
might have been done, but I comfort myself with the
thought, that history (if Russell, not Macaulay, writes
it) will do justice to the constancy and fortitude of the
handful of Englishmen who have for so many weeks&mdash;months,
I may say&mdash;of desperate weather, amid the
greatest toil and hardship, resisted and finally defeated
the worst and most strenuous exertions of an entire
army and a whole nation in arms,&mdash;an army trained by
ourselves, and supplied with all but exhaustless munitions
of war, laid up by ourselves for the maintenance
of our Empire. I venture to aver that no other nation
in the world would have remained here, or have avoided
defeat had they attempted to do so. The delay as yet
has been both morally and politically bad in many ways,
and the results are already beginning to be manifest, but
in the end it will increase our prestige and the moral
effects of our power. A nation which could conquer a
country like the Punjaub so recently with an Hindostanee
army, and then turn the energies of the conquered
Sikhs to subdue the very army by which they were
tamed; which could fight out a position like Peshawur
for years in the very teeth of the Affghan tribes; and
then, when suddenly deprived of the regiments which
effected this, could unhesitatingly employ those very
tribes to disarm and quell those regiments when in mutiny,&mdash;a
nation which could do this is destined indeed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
to rule the world; and the races of Asia must succumb.
This is a proud feeling, and nerves one's arm in many a
time of difficulty and danger, as much almost as the conviction
that we must conquer, or worse than death awaits
us. The intelligence of Sir H. Wheeler's destruction
came to us from too true a source to be doubted,&mdash;it was
in dear Sir Henry Lawrence's own handwriting; and
has been confirmed, alas, too surely. All we do not
know is whether the women and children were massacred
with the men, or whether they escaped, or were
reserved for a worse fate.</p>

<p>One of my news-letters reports that eighteen women
are in prison under the care (?) of Nana Sahib (Bajee
Rao Peishwar's adopted son), who attacked Cawnpore.
You must remember at the artillery review a very "swell"
looking native gentleman, accompanied by another educated
native, who spoke French and other European languages,
and was talking a good deal to Alfred Light.
Well, this was the identical Nana Sahib who has done
all this, and who must even at that very time have been
meditating the treachery, if not the murders.</p>

<p>There is not a word of truth in the report of "the
King of Delhi coming out for a final struggle." Rumor
has been saying so for weeks, with no foundation;
the truth is, the King is a mere puppet, a "ruse." He is
old, and well-nigh impotent, and is only used as authority
for all the acts of rebellion and barbarity enacted by his
sons. The rascals talk (in the city) of coming round on
our rear, and attacking us in the field. I only wish
they would, for in the open plain we should hunt them
down like jackals. They escape us now by flying back
into the city, or under cover of the heavy batteries from
its walls. When (if ever) they do come out, the General
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
has proposed to put the whole of the Irregular Cavalry
under my command, and I trust to give a tolerable
account of the enemy, and show that "Hodson's Horse"
are capable of something, even already.</p>

<p>Colonel Seaton is doing admirably, I am thankful to
say. He is patient and gentle in suffering as a woman,
and this helps his recovery wonderfully.</p>

<p><i>July 27th.</i>&mdash;Since the 23d, hardly a shot has been
fired here. The news-letters from the city mention
meetings in the market-place, and talkings at the corners
of the streets, with big words of what they intend
to do; but they (the people) are actually cowed and
dispirited, while their rulers issue orders which are never
obeyed.</p>

<p>I fear our movements wait upon theirs. We have no
one in power with a head to devise or a heart to dare
any enterprise which might result in the capture of
Delhi; and alas! one cannot but admit that it would
require both a wise head and a very great heart to run
the risk with so reduced a force as we have here now.
2,200 Europeans<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and 1,500 Native Infantry are all that
we now can muster. We have reliable news from below,
that, on or about the 14th, General Havelock, with
the first portion of the European force, met and attacked
the villain Nana, near Futteypore (between Allahabad
and Cawnpore), and beat him thoroughly, capturing his
camp, twelve guns, and seven lac of rupees. The China
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
troops had arrived: Lord Elgin having consented to the
employment of the whole.</p>

<p>Sir P. Grant is coming up with these troops, "on dit,"
so that in six weeks from the date of the Meerut massacre,
11,000 European troops will have landed in India;
what a providential arrival, and what a lesson to Asiatics
that they can never contend with England.</p>

<p>This news has put the whole camp, even the croakers,
of whom there are not a few, in high spirits. I only
hope it is not too good to be true.</p>

<p>As a set-off against this, news has arrived that Tudor
Tucker, his wife, and Sam Fisher, are among the victims
of this horrible insurrection, also, poor James Thomason;
and of his brother-in-law's, Dr. Hay's, execution, there
can be no longer a doubt. How many hecatombs of Sepoys
would it require to atone for their deaths alone.
When shall we see the last; when know the full extent
of these horrible atrocities? The accounts make one's
blood run fire. Our dear Douglas Seaton has arrived in
England, much restored by the voyage, but not, I fear,
sufficiently recovered to return, as soon as he would hear
of the outbreak. A sad blow for him, poor fellow, for
had he been here to command the regiment, he would
probably have been a full Colonel and C. B. at the end.
I am seriously uneasy at receiving no letters from England,
though mail after mail must have arrived, and some
people get their letters! therefore why not I mine? We
get none even from Agra, and of course not below it, except
by "Kossid," and they but little scraps, written half
in Greek characters, to mislead or deceive, if the unfortunate
bearer is stopped. They conceal them very ingeniously
between the leather of their shoes, or tied up
in their hair. I inclose one that came in even a more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
singular letter-bag than either, rolled up in a piece of
wax and packed into a hollow tooth.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; tells me that &mdash;&mdash; was furious at my having the
Guides, but was compelled to acquiesce in it "as it was
undoubtedly the best thing for the public service." How
he must have winced when he was forced to confess that.</p>

<p><i>July 28th.</i>&mdash;I have no news. The Pandies have not
attacked us since the 23d, and are much dispirited. In
reply to your and Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;'s wish to come to Delhi as
nurses, I must say honestly that there is no necessity for
such a sacrifice. Our position here is very different from
that in the Crimea and at Scutari. There the men died
from want of care and of the ordinary necessaries of life.
Here there is no absolute want of anything, except a
genial climate and well-built hospitals, neither of which
you could supply. The men are attended to immediately
they are sick or wounded; and within an hour, sometimes
half that time, of his being wounded, a soldier is
in his bed, with everything actually necessary, and the
greatest medical attention. Unless any unforeseen emergency
should arise, I would strongly dissuade any lady
from coming to camp.</p>

<p>I have always urged the authorities to send away, as
fast as possible, those who have arrived as refugees. We
have a vast camp, or rather position, five miles in circumference,
and we are constantly obliged to take every
man into the field. The guard for our sick is trifling
enough, and our difficulties would be increased were there
women also to be thought of; and God forbid that any
more lives should be risked in this dreadful servile war.
There is also another consideration of much weight
against the tender sympathy which prompts the offer.
How is a delicate woman's constitution to bear up against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
the evils of a tented field in the rains, or render efficient
service in such a climate as this is now? They would
all very speedily become patients in the very hospitals
which they came to serve and would so willingly support.
The flannel garments are invaluable, and this is all that
can be done for us by female hands at present.</p>

<p><i>July 29th.</i>&mdash;I have been so occupied with business all
day that I have only time to say we have had no more
fighting, and the whole atmosphere is still, but hot, oh, so
hot! General Wilson is unwell, and will probably break
down, like the rest. These sexagenarians are unfit for
work in July. I expect Napier will be with the advancing
troops. I sincerely hope so. He is the man to do
something, if they will but let him.</p>

<p><i>July 31st.</i>&mdash;I intended writing more fully to make up
for my late short-comings, but the Pandies permit it not.
They made an attempt on our position this morning;
nothing more, however, than a distant cannonade. A
large party have moved round in our rear, and this has
kept me in the saddle all day. I have just returned,
after some hours of the heaviest rain I was ever out in,
drenched to the skin, of course, and somewhat tired, so
judge what a comfort a dry flannel shirt must be. There
was no actual fighting, so with the exception of keeping
us out so long, and a great expenditure of powder and
shot, no harm was done.</p>

<p><i>August 1st.</i>&mdash;The continued heavy rain promises to
give me more time for pen-work to-day, if no more takes
place on this side of Pandy-monium. The box has
arrived safely with the new "jumpers," &amp;c. Lord William's
additions are invaluable. We have fresh accounts
from below that every European woman and child have
been ruthlessly murdered at Cawnpore. The details are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
too revolting to put on paper, and make one's blood boil.
Mothers with infants in their arms murdered with fiendish
cruelty, and worse than all, two young girls just arrived
from England are said to have been only saved to meet a
worse fate in some Mussulman's zenana. There will be
a day of reckoning for these things, and a fierce one, or I
have been a soldier in vain. You say there is a great
difference between doing one's duty and running unnecessary
risks, and you say truly; the only question is, what
is one's duty. Now, I might, as I have more than once,
see things going wrong at a time and place when I might
be merely a spectator, and not "on duty," or ordered to
be there, and I might feel that by exposing myself to
danger for a time I might rectify matters, and I might
therefore think it right to incur that danger; and yet if I
were to get hit, it would be said "he had no business
there;" nor should I, as far as the rules of the service
go, though in my own mind I should have been satisfied
that I was right. These are times when every man
should do his best, his utmost, and not say, "No; though
I see I can do good there, yet, as I have not been ordered
and am not on duty, I will not do it." This is not my
idea of a soldier's duty, and hitherto the results have
proved me right. Poor Eaton Travers, of Coke's regiment,
was killed this morning. He had just come from
England <i>vi&acirc;</i> Bombay, with a young wife, whom he left
at Lahore. Poor young thing, a sad beginning and end for
her. We send off convoys of the sick and wounded to
Umb&acirc;la, where we hear they are well tended and are
doing well. Even here everything possible is done for
them; Dr. Brougham is an excellent man, and first-rate
surgeon, quite the man of the camp in his line, clever,
indefatigable, and humane.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>
<i>2d.</i>&mdash;The rebels attacked us about 5 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> yesterday,
and kept us at it till seven or eight this morning. Our
people kept steadily at their posts and behind intrenchments,
and drove them back with steady volleys every
time they came near. The result was, that they were
punished severely, while our loss was a very trifling one,
not more than half a dozen Europeans killed and wounded;
it is next to impossible ever to ascertain accurately
what the enemy's loss is.</p>

<p>Colonel Seaton is doing well; in three weeks' time I
hope he will be about again. Before this surely our
rulers will consent to take Delhi. Sickness is on the
increase, and we have been nearly losing another General.
General Wilson was very ill for a few days, but
is now better. He is older, however, by ten years than
he was. The responsibility and anxiety of what is certainly
a very difficult position, have been too much for
him, and he has got into the way of being nervous and
alarmed, and overanxious even about trifles, which shakes
one's dependence on his judgment. These men are personally
as brave as lions, but they have not big hearts or
heads enough for circumstances of serious responsibility.
This word is the bugbear which hampers all our proceedings.
Would we could have had Sir Henry Lawrence
as our leader; we should have been in Delhi weeks ago.
I hope Colonel Napier is coming up with the force. He
has head, and heart, and nerve, and the moral courage to
act as if he had; we hear that the crisis is passing; all
below Cawnpore is safe, and all above Kurn&acirc;l to Peshawur;
while Lord W. Hay keeps the more important
hill stations steady. When all is over, our power will be
stronger than ever, principally because we shall have got
rid of our great sore, a native army.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>
<i>3d.</i>&mdash;4 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> and I have only just got out of the saddle,
and found on my arrival in camp the heaviest news
that has yet reached us. Report says that Sir Henry is
dead! The news wants confirmation, and God grant that
it may be untrue. I should lose one of my best friends,
and the country (in Lord Dalhousie's words on poor
Mackeson) "one whose loss would dim a victory." I
cannot write more to-day; the news has quite unnerved
me.</p>

<p><i>4th.</i>&mdash;Two letters have just arrived from General
Havelock at Cawnpore. They were written at an interval
of ten days, and mentioned his having had three successful
fights, on the 12th, 15th, and 16th of July, and
the reoccupation of Cawnpore. The first of these letters
mentions a report that Sir Henry had died on the
4th July, of wounds received on the 2d; but the second
letter, written ten days later, does not even allude to a
circumstance of such importance, and the Sikh who
brought it, and who left Havelock near Lucknow, on his
way to its relief, maintains that it is not true, and that
Sir Henry Lawrence was alive when he left, as letters
were constantly passing from Havelock's camp to the
"Burra Sahib." God grant, for his country's sake and
for mine, that it be not true. To the country his death
would be worse than the loss of a province; to me it
would be the loss of my truest and most valued friend.
I hope, yet fear to hope, that it may be a false report;
yet what soldier would wish a more noble, a more brilliant
end to such a career? Havelock has captured all
the enemy's guns, and inflicted severe punishment. The
destruction of Sir Hugh Wheeler and his party is fully
confirmed, and Havelock was too late to save the unfortunate
women and children, who were massacred in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
prison, before his arrival, by their guards. Such fiends
as these our arms have never met with in any part of the
world. May our vengeance be as speedy as it will unquestionably
be sure!</p>

<p>We (Hodson's Horse) are getting on very comfortably,
and are going to start a mess on our own account, so as
to be ready to march without difficulty when required.</p>

<p><i>5th.</i>&mdash;To-day the accounts received from a native
Commissariat Agent, arrived at Meerut from Lucknow,
are positive as to Sir H. Lawrence being alive a fortnight
after he was said to have died. This, if reliable,
is good indeed. The letter I annex<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> from Colonel Tytler
gives good news, and the man who brought the letter,
says there were fourteen steamers and flats at Cawnpore
when he left. The troops had taken Bithoor, the Nana's
place, and at first it was uninjured, but the bodies of some
English women were found inside the Nana's house, on
which the European soldiers, excited to irresistible fury,
destroyed every human being in the place, and then demolished
the building, not leaving one stone upon another.
The Nana himself, with his family, took refuge in a boat
on the river, and the native accounts add that he sunk
it, and all were drowned. This I strongly doubt; such
Spartan heroism could scarcely exist in the mind of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
one who could violate and massacre helpless women and
children. Indeed, I hope it is not true; for it is one of
my aims to have the catching of the said Nana myself.
The hanging him would be a positive pleasure to me. I
trust the day of retribution is not far distant.</p>

<p><i>6th.</i>&mdash;Small chance of much writing to-day, for just
as I have got into camp, after some hours' attendance on
the pleasure of the Pandies, who came out in force and
threatened an attack, I find that I have to start on a long
reconnoitring expedition, from which I cannot return till
late at night. This is unfortunate, as I have much pen-work
on hand, my necessary official writing being very
onerous. I was obliged to write as long a letter as I
could to Lord W. Hay, if but to thank him, in my own
and others' name, for the comforts he so thoughtfully
sent us.</p>

<p>I have a very complimentary letter from G. Barnes,
the Commissioner, as well as some others, enough to turn
one's head with vanity; but I have had bitter experience
of its rottenness, and take the flattery at its full value,
namely, "nil." I fear, from fresh reports arrived, that
Havelock will not come and help us after all. They say
he has the strictest orders to relieve Lucknow only, and
that however much he may desire to march on to Delhi,
it is out of his power to do so. It is true we do not want
him. Delhi surely must be taken as soon as ever the
reinforcements get down here from the Punjaub. Our
rulers must then see the necessity for action.</p>

<p><i>7th.</i>&mdash;I returned at three o'clock this morning from a
forty miles' ride over the worst and wettest country I
was ever in, and I am thoroughly exhausted, though
everybody is wanting something, and I must attend to
business first, and then to rest.</p>

<p>
<i>8th.</i>&mdash;I could write nothing but official papers all the
sedentary part of yesterday. I did not get in till 9 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>
The news from below mentions good dear old Dr. Lyell
as among the killed at Patna. Brave, noble fellow, his
gallant spirit has led him to the front once too often. He
had always as much of the warrior as of the surgeon in
him. The report has again gained ground of dear Sir
Henry's death, but my heart refuses credence to so great
a misfortune. I do trust that when the 52d arrive, we
may be allowed to do something better than this pot-shot
work. Nicholson has come on ahead, and is a host in
himself, if he does not go and get knocked over as Chamberlain
did. The camp is all alive at the notion of something
decisive taking place soon, but I cannot rally from
the fear of dear Sir Henry's fate. How many of my
friends are gone. My heart is divided between grief for
those precious victims, and deep gratitude to God for my
own safety and that of those dearest to me. May He in
His mercy preserve me for further exertion and an ultimate
reunion, and if not, His will be done. I have a
letter from an unfortunate woman, a Mrs. Leeson, who
was saved from the slaughter at Delhi, on May 11th, by
an Affghan lad, after she had been wounded, and her
child slaughtered in her arms. She is still concealed in
the Affghan's house. I heard that there was a woman
there, and managed to effect a communication with her,
through one of the Guides, and to send her money, &amp;c.,
and so I think the poor creature may be preserved till
we enter Delhi, if we fail in getting her free before. I
fear she is the only European, or rather the only Christian
(for she herself is hardly European), left alive from
the massacre. Her husband was the son of Major Leeson,
and a clerk in a Government office in Delhi. I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
sent one of our few prisoners up to Forsyth at Umb&acirc;la,
whom we ironically call the "Maid of Delhi," though
her age and character are questionable, and her ugliness
undoubted. She actually came out on horseback, and fought
against us like a fiend. The General at first released her,
but knowing how mischievous she would be among those
superstitious Mahommedans, I persuaded him to let her
be recaptured, and made over for safe custody. It is a
moot point whether any assault will be made as soon as
the 52d arrive. I can only go on hoping, but I confess
I am not very sanguine about anything being done now.</p>

<p>Our General, since his illness, has got a still weaker
dread of responsibility, and ceased to be nearly as vigorous
even as heretofore. Would indeed that we had had
Sir H. Lawrence here; that he may have been, and still
be spared to us, is my prayer! The consequences of
longer delay will be more and more disastrous to the
health of the troops. Captain Daly has not formally
reassumed command of the Guides, though he virtually
does all the sedentary work. By an arrangement which
I cannot but think unwise, and which deprives the corps
of two thirds of its value, they have separated the regiment
into two, putting the cavalry into the Cavalry Brigade
under Hope Grant, and the infantry at the other
end of the camp under Shebbeare, and Major Reid of
the Goorkhas, who commands all the posts and pickets
on our right.</p>

<p>The Guides should not be separated, and should be
kept as much apart as may be from other corps. No
regiment in the world have done or will do better than
they, with a little prudence, and under an officer whom
they like and can trust. My own regiment is also in the
Cavalry Brigade, and is very hard-worked. It is bad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
for a young and unformed corps, but there is such a
scarcity of cavalry here, that I cannot even remonstrate,
and I get no small amount of <span class="greek" title="kudos">&#954;&#8166;&#948;&#959;&#962;</span> for having so large a
number of men fit to be put on duty within two months
of receiving the order to raise a regiment. I shall have
two more troops in with the 52d, and Nicholson has given
me fifty Affghans, just joined him from Peshawur, which,
added to thirty coming with Alee Reza Khan from Lahore,
will complete an Affghan troop as a counterpoise to
my Punjaubees.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>We expect the movable column on the 12th or 13th,
weather permitting, and some other troops a day or two
after. Sir P. Grant is supposed to be at Cawnpore, but
we have no tidings later than Colonel Tytler's letter.
There is no actual fighting going on here, nothing except
the usual cannonade. The rebels bring out guns on all
sides, and fire away day and night, but bring no troops
forward, and as we act strictly on the defensive, we merely
reply to their guns with ours. The whole affair is reduced
to a combat of artillery, our leader's favorite arm,
excellent when combined with the other two, but if he
expects to get into Delhi with that alone, I guess he will
find himself mistaken. The news of disaffection in the
city is daily confirmed. On the 7th a powder manufactory
exploded, and they suspended the minister, Hakeem
Ahsanoolah, and searched his house; there they found a
letter which had been sent him, concocted by Moulvie
Rujub Alee, which confirmed their suspicions, so they
plundered and burnt his house, while he himself was only
saved by taking refuge in the palace with the King, his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
master, who it seems is kept close prisoner there, his sons
giving all orders, and ruling with a rod of iron. They
say, however, that the King has got leave to send his
wives and women out of the Ajmere gate to the Kootub.
I trust it may be so, for we do not war with women, and
should be sadly puzzled to know what to do with them
as prisoners.</p>

<p><i>August 11th.</i>&mdash;The bridge over the Jumna resists all
efforts for its destruction. Our engineers have tried
their worst, and failed. I have tried all that money
could do, to the extent of 6,000 rupees, but equally in
vain. So there it remains for the benefit of the enemy,
whose principal reinforcements come from that side of
the city. Two messengers of my own, arrived from
Lucknow, leave little hope of dear Sir Henry's life having
been spared. I grieve as for a brother....</p>

<p>Talking of jealousies, one day, under a heavy fire, Captain
&mdash;&mdash; came up to me, and begged me to forget and
forgive what had passed, and only to remember that we
were soldiers fighting together in a common cause. As I
was the injured party, I could afford to do this. The
time and place, as well as his manner, appealed to my
better feelings, so I held out my hand at once. Now-a-days,
we must stand by and help each other, forget all
injuries, and rise superior to them, or, God help us! we
should be in terrible plight.</p>

<p><i>August 12th.</i>&mdash;This morning a force under Colonel
Showers moved down before daybreak towards the city,
or rather the gardens outside the city gates, and gave the
enemy, who had been ensconced behind the garden walls
for a couple of days, and given our pickets annoyance, a
good thrashing, taking four of their guns, and inflicting a
heavy loss. All were back in camp by 7 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>, so it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
a very comfortable little affair. Our fellows did admirably.
Captain Greville captured one gun with a handful
of men, getting slightly wounded in the act. Showers
himself, Coke, and young Owen, were also wounded, and
poor young Sheriff of the 2d mortally so; the loss among
the men was small in proportion to the success. The return
to camp was a scene worth witnessing, the soldiers
bringing home in triumph the guns they had captured, a
soldier, with musket and bayonet fixed, riding each horse,
and brave young Owen astride one gun, and dozens clinging
to and pushing it, or rather them, along with might
and main, and cheering like mad things. I was in the
thick of it by accident, for I was looking on as well as I
could through the gloom, when Coke asked me to find
Brigadier Showers and say he was wounded, and that
the guns were taken. I found Showers himself wounded,
and then had to find a field-officer to take command,
after which, I assisted generally in drawing off the men&mdash;the
withdrawal or retirement being the most difficult
matter always, and requiring as much steadiness as an
attack.</p>

<p><i>August 13th.</i>&mdash;I wish I could get some pay, but money
is terribly scarce and living dear; my favorite beverage,
tea, particularly so. I have therefore sent to Umb&acirc;la for
some.</p>

<p>Ghoolab Singh's death is unfortunate at this juncture,
but I fancy we have too much to do just now to interfere
with the succession; we ought not to do so according to
treaty, and if Jowahir Singh tries to recover the country
from his cousin, Runbeer Singh, the King's son, why that
is his affair, not ours&mdash;though we should never be contented
to let them fight it out and settle it themselves.
Poor Light has been brought very low by dysentery, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
can hardly crawl about, but about he persists in going,
brave fellow as he is. What a contrast to &mdash;&mdash;, who has
got away, sick or pretending to be so, to the hills,&mdash;anything
to escape work. Greville is, I am thankful to say,
not badly wounded, and as plucky as ever. All well at
Agra; no news from below.</p>

<p><i>August 14th.</i>&mdash;On returning from a rather disheartening
<i>reconnaissance</i> to-day, I found letters which soothed
and comforted my weary spirit, just as a sudden gleam of
sunlight brightens a gloomy landscape, and brings all surrounding
objects into light and distinctness.</p>

<p>I am no croaker, but I confess sometimes it requires
all one's trust in the God of battles, and all the comforting
and sustaining words of those nearest and dearest to
us, to bear up boldly and bravely through these weary
days. A letter from good Douglas Seaton was among
them. He little thought that so soon after his departure
we should all be moving downwards, and that I should
receive his letter in his brother's tent in "Camp before
Delhi;" his own dearly loved regiment<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> "next door" to
us. How wonderfully uncertain everything is in India.
I am interrupted by orders to start to-night for Rohtuck,
and must go and make arrangements.

<span class="smcap">Bohur, near Rohtuck</span>, <i>August 17th</i>.
</p>

<p>I have been unable to write since we left Delhi, as we
have been incessantly marching, and had no means of
communicating with any one. Even now I am doubtful
whether this will reach camp. We left Delhi during the
night of the 14th-15th, and marched to Khurkundah, a
large village, in which I had heard that a great number of
the rascally Irregulars had taken refuge. We surprised
and attacked the village. A number of the enemy got into
a house, and fought like devils; but we mastered them and
slew the whole. Yesterday we marched on here, intending
to reconnoitre and harass "&agrave; la Cosaque" a large party of
horsemen and foot, with two guns, who have been moving
along from Delhi, plundering the wretched villagers <i>en
route</i>, and threatening to attack Hansie. They, however,
thought discretion the better part of valor, and, hearing
of our approach, started off at a tangent before we got
near enough to stop them.</p>

<p>We have been drenched with rain, so I am halting to
dry and feed both men and horses, and then we go on to
Rohtuck. I have nearly 300 men and five officers,&mdash;Ward,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
Wise, the two Goughs, and Macdowell,&mdash;all first-rate
soldiers. I have eighty Guides, and the rest my
own men, who do wonderfully, considering how sadly untrained
and undisciplined they are. We are roughing it
in more ways than one, and the sun is terribly hot; but
we are all well and in high spirits, for though it is a bold
game to play, I am too careful to run unnecessary risks,
or get into a fix. I have done a good deal already, and
shall, I hope, recover Rohtuck to-day, when I do trust the
authorities will consent to keep it, and not let us have the
work to do twice over, as at Bh&aacute;gput.

<p>
<span class="smcap">My Dear Colonel</span>,&mdash;We are getting on very well.
I hope to take Rohtuck to-day, and I trust arrangements
will be made for keeping it. The country will then be
quiet from Hansie to Delhi. The Jheend Rajah should
be told to take care of the district. I believe Greathed
did make this arrangement, but Barnes put some spoke
in the way, so that the Rajah is uncertain how to act.
Please tell Greathed from me that there is nothing now
to prevent the restoration of order here. I wish I had
a stronger party, for though I feel quite comfortable myself,
yet I should like more troops, for the sake of the
men, who are not quite so easy in their minds. The
road by Alipore, Boanah, and Khurkundah is the best.
The canal is easily fordable at Boanah, and just below
that place (at the escape) it is quite dry, the banks having
given way. We polished off the Khurkundah gentry
in style, though they showed fight to a great extent. It
has had a wonderfully calming effect on the neighborhood.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
I hope the Jheend troops, or some troops, may be sent
here. The Jheend men would more than suffice.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
This is the first rest since Bohur; we have had very
hard work, great heat, and long exposure; but, thank
God, are all well and safe, and have done some business.
I marched from Bohur on the evening of the 17th. On
reaching Rohtuck, we found the Mussulman portion of
the people, and a crowd of Irregulars drawn up on the
walls, while a considerable party were on a mound outside.
I had ridden forward with Captain Ward and a
few orderlies to see how the land lay, when the rascals
fired, and ran towards us. I sent word for my cavalry to
come up, and rode slowly back myself, in order to tempt
them out, which had partly the desired effect, and as soon as
my leading troop came up, we dashed at them and drove
them helter-skelter into the town, killing all we overtook.
We then encamped in what was the Kutcherry compound,
and had a grateful rest and a quiet night. The representatives
of the better-disposed part of the population came out
to me, and amply provided us with supplies for both man
and beast. The rest were to have made their "amende"
in the morning; but a disaffected Rangur went off early,
and brought up 300 Irregular horsemen of the mutineers,&mdash;1st,
13th, 14th, and other rebels,&mdash;and having
collected about 1,000 armed rascals on foot, came out to
attack my little party of barely 300 sabres and six officers.
The Sowars dashed at a gallop up the road, and came
boldly enough up to our camp. I had, a few minutes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
before, fortunately received notice of their intentions, and
as I had kept the horses ready saddled, we were out and
at them in a few seconds. To drive them scattering back
to the town was the work of only as many more, and I
then, seeing their numbers, and the quantity of matchlocks
brought against us from gardens and embrasures,
determined to draw them out into the open country; and
the "ruse" was eminently successful. I had quietly sent
off our little baggage unperceived, half an hour before,
so that I was, as I intended, perfectly free and unfettered
by <i>impedimenta</i> of any sort. I then quietly and gradually
drew off troop after troop into the open plain about a mile
to the rear, covering the movement with skirmishers.
My men, new as well as old, behaved coolly and admirably
throughout, though the fire was very annoying, and a
retreat is always discouraging, even when you have an
object in view. My officers, fortunately first-rate ones,
behaved like veterans, and everything went on to my
complete satisfaction. Exactly what I had anticipated
happened. The enemy thought we were bolting, and
came on in crowds, firing and yelling, and the Sowars
brandishing their swords as if we were already in their
hands, when suddenly I gave the order, "Threes about,
and at them." The men obeyed with a cheer; the effect
was electrical; never was such a scatter. I launched
five parties at them, each under an officer, and in they
went, cutting and firing into the very thick of them.
The ground was very wet, and a ditch favored them, but
we cut down upwards of fifty in as many seconds. The
remainder flew back to the town, as if, not the Guides
and Hodson's Horse, but death and the devil were at
their heels. Their very numbers encumbered them, and
the rout was most complete. Unfortunately I had no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
ammunition left, and therefore could not without imprudence
remain so close to a town filled with matchlock men,
so we marched quietly round to the north of the town,
and encamped near the first friendly village we came to,
which we reached in the early afternoon. Our success was
so far complete, and I am most thankful to say with very
trifling loss, only two men rather severely wounded, eight
in all touched, and a few horses hit. Macdowell did
admirably, as indeed did all. My new men, utterly untrained
as they are, many unable to ride or even load
their carabines properly, yet behaved beyond my most
sanguine expectations for a first field, and this success,
without loss, will encourage them greatly.</p>

<p>This morning I was joined by a party of Jheend
horse, whom my good friend the Rajah sent as soon as
he heard I was coming Rohtuck-wards, so I have now
400 horsemen, more or less, fresh ammunition having
come in this morning, and am quite independent. I hear
also that the General has at my recommendation sent out
some troops in this direction; if so, order will be permanently
restored in this district. In three days we
have frightened away and demoralized a force of artillery,
cavalry, and infantry some 2,000 strong, beat those
who stood or returned to fight us, twice, in spite of numbers,
and got fed and furnished forth by the rascally town
itself.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Moreover, we have thoroughly cowed the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
neighborhood, and given them a taste of what more they
will get unless they keep quiet in future. We count
eighty-five killed, and numbers wounded, since we left
Delhi, which is one good result, even if there were no
other. One of them was a brute of the 14th Irregular
Cavalry, who committed such butchery at Jhansi. No
letters have reached me since I left camp, and I am not
sure that this will reach there safely. It is a terribly
egotistical detail, and I am thoroughly ashamed of saying
so much of myself, but you insisted on having a full,
true, and particular account, so do not think me vainglorious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lursowlie</span>, <i>August 22d</i>.&mdash;I rode over to this place
from our little camp at Sonput, eight miles off, to see
Saunders and Colonel Durnsford. I find that two of
my new troops have been detained on the road, but will
reach Delhi in a day or two, and others from Lahore
will soon arrive. I think the business at Rohtuck has
been very creditable to us, but I can write no more than
the assurance of our safety and well-being.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camp, Sonput</span>, <i>August 23d</i>.&mdash;I could only write a
few hurried lines yesterday. Late in the evening I got
a note from General Wilson, desiring me to look out for
and destroy the 10th Light Cavalry mutineers from
Ferozepoor. He authorized my proceeding to Jheend,
but without going through the Rohtuck district. Now,
as to do this would involve an immense detour, and insure
my being too late, and consequently having a long
and fatiguing march for my pains, I wrote back to explain
this, and requested more definite instructions. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
must either say distinctly "do this or that," and I will do
it; or he must give me <i>carte blanche</i> to do what he wants
in the most practicable way, of which I, knowing the
country, can best judge. I am not going to fag my men
and horses to death, and then be told I have exceeded
my instructions. He gives me immense credit for what
I have done, but "almost wishes I had not ventured so
far." The old gentleman means well, but does not understand
either the country or the position I was in, nor
does he appreciate a tenth part of the effects which our
bold stroke at Rohtuck, forty-five miles from camp, has
produced. "<i>N'importe</i>," they will find it out sooner or
later. I hear both Chamberlain and Nicholson took my
view of the case, and supported me warmly.</p>

<p>I am much gratified by General Johnstone's exertions
in my favor, though I have not the slightest idea that
they will eventuate in anything; but the motive is the
same. Let me do what I will, I have made up my mind
to gain nothing but the approval of my own conscience.
I foresee that I shall remain a subaltern, and the easygoing
majors of brigade, aides-de-camp, and staff-officers
will all get brevets, C. B.'s, &amp;c., for simply living in
camp, and doing their simple duties mildly and without
exertion. The Victoria Cross, I confess, is the highest
object of my ambition, and had I been one of fortune's
favorites I should have had it ere now even, but I have
learnt experience in a rough school and am prepared for
the worst; but whether a lieutenant or lieutenant-general,
I trust I shall continue to do my duty, to the best
of my judgment and ability, as long as strength and
sense are vouchsafed to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camp, Delhi</span>, <i>August 24th</i>.&mdash;I returned here this
morning at 2 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>, very tired and unwell, and not able
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
to write much, for I have been obliged to have recourse
to the doctor.</p>

<p>People have got an absurd story about my being shut
up in a fort, without food or chance of escape! The
General's aide-de-camp tells me the old man believed
this ridiculous report and was fairly frightened, getting
no sleep for two nights. However, he fully admits the
good service we have rendered, and every one is making
a talk and fuss about it,&mdash;as if success were uncommon!
I find strong hopes of our making an assault on the city
as soon as the siege train arrives, which will be in about
thirteen days. Havelock seems unable or unwilling to
move on, but we can hardly want him, for surely we
shall have ample means for taking the city shortly.</p>

<p>I am to have a surgeon attached to my regiment at
once, as I represented how cruel it was to send us out
on an expedition without a doctor or a grain of medicine.
We had eight wounded men, and two officers had fever
on the road, and nothing but the most primitive means
of relieving them. I asked for Dr. Charles, but there
are so many senior to him waiting for a turn, that I
must be content for the present with what I can get. I
hope, however, to have Charles ultimately, for he is skilful,
clever, a gentleman, and a Christian.</p>

<p>Nicholson has just gone out to look after a party of
the enemy with twelve guns, who had moved out yesterday
towards Nujjufghur, threatening to get into our rear.
I wanted to have gone with him, but I was laughingly
told to stay at home and nurse myself, and let some one
else have a chance of doing good service. This was too
bad, especially as Nicholson wished me to go.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>&mdash;It is 4 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>, and I am only just free from
people and papers, but good news must make up for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
brevity. General Nicholson has beaten the enemy gloriously
at Nujjufghur, whither he pushed on last evening.
He has taken thirteen guns, and all the camp equipage
and property. Our loss was small for the gain, but two
of the killed were officers,&mdash;young Lumsden of Coke's
Corps, a most promising fellow, and Dr. Ireland. The
victory is a great one, and will shake the Pandies' nerves,
I calculate. All their shot and ammunition were also
captured. The 1st Fusileers were as usual "to the
fore," and did well equally as usual. I am much disappointed
at not having been there, but Mactier would not
hear of it, as the weather was bad, and I should have run
the risk of another attack of dysentery, from which I
had been suffering. I am half annoyed, half amused at
the absurd stories about the Rohtuck business. We were
never in any extremity whatever, nor did I ever feel
the slightest anxiety, or cease to feel that I was master
of the situation. Danger there must always be in war,
but none of our own creating, as the fools and fearful
said, ever existed; would that folks would be contented
with the truth and reality of our position, and not add to
its <i>d&eacute;sagr&eacute;mens</i> by idle fears and false inventions.</p>

<p><i>27th</i>.&mdash;I have been up to my eyes in work all day
again, and not had the pen out of my hand all day,
except when on horseback with the men. Two troops
arrived yesterday, and I have 250 spare horses to mount
them, so that we are getting on by degrees. Such an
experiment as raising a regiment actually in camp on
active (and very active) service, was never tried before.</p>

<p>I most decidedly object and refuse to allow Mr. &mdash;&mdash; to
publish any extracts whatever from my letters. I say
nothing that I am ashamed of, nothing that is not strictly
true, but my remarks on men and measures, however
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
just, would make me many enemies, and my misfortunes
have taught me, though I may not condescend to conciliate,
at least to do nothing to offend. If, however, it will
be any amusement to the loved ones at home to have
some true sketches of this lamentable siege, and the
progress in it of one dear to them, that is quite another
affair, and I confess I should like to have some such
references myself to look over hereafter.</p>

<p><i>28th.</i>&mdash;I am somewhat surprised at not hearing from
Agra, but I cannot be sure that my letter reached there,
as several of the "Kossids" have been "scragged" on the
road. Sir P. Grant will not have a long course to run,
as Sir C. Campbell has been sent out to command, and is
in India, I fancy, by this time. Havelock, we hear, has
retreated, leaving Lucknow still unrelieved. I cannot
understand this, but we have not sufficient information to
enable us to judge. After all, Nicholson is the General
after my heart.</p>

<p><i>29th.</i>&mdash;I have just returned from a ride of twelve
hours, leaving camp at three <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>, on a reconnoitring
expedition, and have only time before the d&acirc;k closes to
say that I am safe and well. I found no enemy, and
everything quiet in the direction of Nujjufghur, where
I was to-day, over and beyond Nicholson's field of battle
of the 25th.</p>

<p><i>30th.</i>&mdash;I have been writing and listening all this
morning till I am tired, a man having come in from
Delhi, with much assurance and great promises; but he
was sent back rather humbler than he came, for he fancied
he should make terms, and could not get a single
promise of even bare life for any one, from the King
downwards. If I get into the palace, the house of Timur
will not be worth five minutes' purchase, I ween; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
what my share in this work will be, no one can say, as
there will be little work for horsemen, and I do not now
command any infantry to give me an excuse. I hope
Sir C. Campbell will be here to lead us into the city,
which seems probable at our present rate of no-progress.
He is a very good man for the post of Commander-in-Chief,
as he has had great experience in India and elsewhere,
and that, recent experience. Mansfield comes out
with him as chief of the staff, with the rank of Major-General.</p>

<p><i>31st.</i>&mdash;I have little public news for you; all is expected
here. The siege train will be in by the 3d or
4th, I fancy, and then I trust there will be no more
waiting.</p>

<p>The letters from Agra show that a much greater and
more formidable amount of insurrection exists than we
were prepared to believe. Large bodies of insurgents
have collected in different places all over the country, all
well supplied with arms and guns. These are under the
orders of different Nawabs, Rajahs, and big men, who
think that now is their time for rule. None of these will
be formidable as soon as the army is disposed of, but for
a long time to come we shall have marching and fighting,
punishing and dispersing, and it is to be expected that
bodies of the fugitives from Delhi will join the standards
of these insurgent leaders, and give us trouble here and
there. The fall of Delhi will not be the end, but rather
the beginning of a new campaign in the field; but the
very day the active portion of the work is over, I shall
ask to go to some good station, and organize and discipline
my regiment, and get it properly equipped, and fit
for service. At present it is merely an aggregation
of untutored horsemen, ill-equipped, half clothed, badly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
provided with everything, quite unfit for service in the
usual sense of the term, and only forced into the field
because I have willed that it shall be so; but it would
take six months' constant work to fit it properly for service.
Generally when a regiment is raised, it is left
quietly at one station until the commanding officer reports
it "fit for service," and it has been inspected and reported
upon by a general officer, when it is brought "on
duty" by order of the Commander-in-Chief. My idea
of being able to raise a regiment when in the field, and
on actual, and very active service, was ridiculed and
pooh-poohed, but I stuck to it that it could be done, and
General Anson was only too willing I should try, hitherto
with success, and with the considerable gain, to an army
deficient in cavalry, of having a good body of horsemen
brought at once on duty in the field. How long it may
be before I am able to get to a quiet station for the purpose
required, it is impossible to foresee. I shall try to
get sent to Umb&acirc;la, or as near the Punjaub as possible,
because my men are all drawn from thence, and it will
be easier to recruit, than at a greater distance from Sikh-land.
I have got six full troops, and another is on its
way down.</p>

<p><i>September 1st.</i>&mdash;This is muster-day, and a very busy
one to me, but I have written a minute letter to go by
Kossid to Agra once more. The poor wretch who took
my last was murdered on the road, so of course, the letter
never reached Agra. The d&acirc;k by Meerut is again suspended,
so we can only send by Kossid. I have to-day
got a new subaltern, a Mr. Baker, of the late 60th Native
Infantry, and a doctor, so we are seven in all. I could
not succeed in getting Dr. Charles just yet, but hope to
do so eventually. Little Nusrut Jung has been allowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
to come to me from the Guides, and I have made him a
jemadar at once. It is astonishing how well he reads and
remembers English. The Testament you gave him is his
constant companion, he tells me, and he is as interested
as ever in the history of "our wonderful prophet." The
Persians are certainly a very intelligent race, this one
particularly so, and the seeds you have sown will surely
bring forth fruit to his eternal benefit hereafter. More
than half the Guides want to come to my new corps, but
this is of course out of the question. I am sending for
Heratees and Candaharees, the farther from Hindostan
the better. Mr. Ricketts, too, is collecting men from his
district. I have at present 200 spare horses, but as I am
to raise 1,200 or 1,400 men, I fear mounting them will be
a difficulty; it is very difficult to work in a camp on service
where so little can be got or bought. Here come
more news-letters from the city, and myriads of notes,
besides post-time and parade, all at once! I shall be
glad when Delhi falls, and I cease to be <i>Times</i>, <i>Morning
Chronicle</i>, and <i>Post</i>, all in one!<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p><i>2d.</i>&mdash;... "Hodson's Horse" made a very respectable
show indeed last evening, when paraded all together for
the first time, and I was much complimented on my success;
there are some in the last batch from Lahore whom
I shall ultimately get rid of, wild low-caste fellows, and
they did not behave very well the other day at the Ravee
with Nicholson; but, taken altogether, I am very well
satisfied, and trust they will eventually turn out well, and
do credit to the hard work I have with them. Colonel
Seaton is better,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, his wound is healed,&mdash;but he
suffers much pain from the tender state of the scarce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
united muscles when he moves. The weather is very
trying just now, and very unhealthy. Poor Macdowell
is unwell, and I fear he will have to go away sick; he is
far from strong, which is his only fault, poor boy. I like
him increasingly, he is a thorough gentleman. For myself,
I am wonderfully well, that is, as well as most in
camp, though somewhat pulled down by heat, fatigue,
and dysentery, and I am literally one of the "lean kine."
All is quite quiet here; only a few occasional shots from
the batteries. The Pandies are quarrelling among themselves,
and are without money; they cannot hold together
much longer, and I fear will break up if we do not speedily
take the place. Only a chosen band (!) will rally
round the King, who, after all, is but a name, for his villanous
sons are the real leaders. The train is to be here
to-morrow or next day, and 56 guns are to open on the
walls at once. We hear that Captain Peel, of Crimean
celebrity, is on his way up to Allahabad, with a naval
brigade and some sixty-eight pounders from his ship <i>The
Shannon</i>. Glorious, this. Surely with the brave little
army which has withstood all (and none but ourselves
can know what that "all" comprises) the trials of these
last months, and our own brave "tars," we shall speedily
conquer this rebellious city, and make the last of the
house of Timur "eat dirt."</p>

<p><i>September 3d.</i>&mdash; Nothing is going on here of public
importance, and everything is stagnant, save the hand of
the destroying angel of sickness; we have at this moment
2,500 in hospital, of whom 1,100 are Europeans, out of
a total of 5,000 men (Europeans), and yet our General
waits and waits for this and that arrival, forgetful that
each succeeding day diminishes his force by more than
the strength of the expected driblets. He talks now of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
awaiting the arrival of three weak regiments of Ghoolab
Singh's force under Richard Lawrence, who are
marching from Umb&acirc;la. Before they arrive, if the General
really does wait for them, we shall have an equivalent
to their numbers sickened and dying from the delay
in this plague spot. "Delhi in September" is proverbial,
and this year we seem likely to realize its full horrors.
The train will be here to-morrow or next day, and I hope
our General will not lose a day after that. He is a good
artillery officer, with an undue estimate of his own arm
of the service. He seems to realize the old saying, that
officers of a "special arm," such as artillery and engineers,
do not make generals. Wilson, for instance, looks
upon guns as engines capable mathematically of performing
perfect results, and acts as cautiously as if in practice
such results were ever attained by Asiatic gunners, forgetting
all our glorious Indian annals, all the experience
of a British army, and hesitating before an Indian foe!
I never hear these old gentlemen talk without thinking
of Sir Charles Napier's remarks on the Duke's comments
on "Colonel Monson's retreat," and the heroic way in
which he had read and profited by the lesson.</p>

<p>As to the extracts from my letters which Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;
has asked for, I must decidedly refuse; even supposing
them to be of the importance which he professes to consider
them, there is a vast distinction between my publishing,
or allowing to be published, my letters, and
letting my friends read or make use of them. I am perfectly
at liberty to write and speak freely to my friends,
and they may show such parts of my letters as they think
fit, to men in power and in Parliament; and these may
again make use, in debate or in council, of knowledge
thus gained, and details thus imparted, which would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
otherwise beyond their reach. All this is right, fair, and
of every-day occurrence; but I myself, as a military officer,
have no right to publish, or permit to be published,
comments written, in the freedom of private correspondence,
on my superiors, their acts, and proceedings.</p>

<p>I have not the smallest objection to any of our friends
seeing my written opinions, provided they know them to
be extracted from private letters, and never intended for
publication. I have no objection to Lord William Hay
sending a copy, if he chooses, to Lord Dalhousie, or Lord
Ellenborough himself even; but I cannot give permission
to any one to publish what would be so injurious to my
interests. You will think I have grown strangely worldly-wise;
but have I not had bitter experience?</p>

<p><i>September 4th.</i>&mdash;There is nothing to tell of public
news, and even if there were I have no time to tell it,
for I am very busy and hard-worked, and only too thankful
to get a few minutes to say I am safe and well. I
have never written of public matters except as regarded
myself. As to the stories about me at Rohtuck, the
papers have repeatedly published the true as well as the
false version of the tale,&mdash;even the <i>Lahore Chronicle</i>
got it pretty correctly; and after all, it is of very little
consequence what the papers say as long as the correct
version goes to Government and my friends. I sincerely
trust we shall be in Delhi before the 15th.</p>

<p><i>September 5th.</i>&mdash;Poor Macdowell has had a bad attack
of fever, which has brought him very low. He will have
to go to the hills, I very much fear. The amount of
sickness is terrible; we have 2,500 men in hospital, and
numbers of officers besides. Another of the 61st, Mr.
Tyler, died of cholera to-day. I would give a great deal
to get away, if but for a week, but I must go where I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
can do most towards avenging the past, and securing our
common safety for the future. No arrangements are
making for any movements after the capture of Delhi;
we sadly want a head over us.</p>

<p><i>September 6th.</i>&mdash;To-night I believe the engineers are
really to begin work constructing batteries, so that in two
or three days Delhi ought to be taken. If General Wilson
delays now, he will have nothing left to take; all the
Sepoys will be off to their homes, or into Rohilcund, or
into Gwalior. News from Cawnpore to 25th August has
been received. Up to that date Lucknow was safe, but
with only fifteen days' provisions left; and apparently no
vigorous measures being taken to relieve the place.
Havelock has not enough men, he says; and report adds
that the Governor-General has forbidden other regiments
to move on, wishing to keep them at Benares to cover
Calcutta. This appears incredible. The Sepoys in
Delhi are in hourly expectation of our attack, and the
cavalry keep their horses saddled night and day, ready to
bolt at a moment's notice,&mdash;so say the news-letters. I
suspect that, the moment we make an attack in earnest,
the rebel force will disappear. Of public news I have
none beyond this, and I am still, like every one else, in
the dark as to what we do after Delhi is taken, or where
and when we go. If the campaign lasts very long I shall
be forced to go home next year, for even my health will
not stand against many more months of wear and tear
like the last. Yet who can say what even a day may
bring forth, or can venture to make plans for a future
year, after the experiences of the last? God's merciful
providence has hitherto preserved me most wonderfully
from myriads of no common dangers, and I humbly pray
that I may be spared to see my home, and those who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
make home so dear, once more. Home, altered and
bereaved as it is since I left it, still holds the precious
sisters and brothers of the past, and the bright new generation
with whom I long to make acquaintance.</p>

<p><i>September 7th.</i>&mdash;News has just been received up to
the 27th from Cawnpore: the garrison in Lucknow had
been attacked by the enemy in vast numbers, headed by
a lot of "Ghazees." They were repulsed with such
severe loss that the enemy would not venture to try that
game again, were the siege to be protracted for two
years; they say 150 Ghazees, and between 400 and 500
Sepoys were killed. Colonel Otter was appointed commandant
of Allahabad, at which I rejoice, for he will
"come out strong" whenever he has a chance. One of
our batteries was armed (<i>i.e.</i>, guns put into it) last
night, and the bigger one will be made to-night; so that
by the 9th I trust Delhi will be ours.</p>

<p><i>September 8th.</i>&mdash;To-day two new batteries, constructed
during the night for the heavy guns, opened on the walls
and bastions of the city, and the cannonade on both sides
has been very heavy; to-morrow other batteries will be
ready, and on the following day fifty guns, I trust, will
be at work on the doomed city. Very little loss was
experienced during the night, only two men being hit;
and the casualties to-day have been surprisingly few.
I cannot believe there will be any serious resistance
when once the enemy's guns are silenced. There is at
present nothing to lead one to suppose that the enemy
have any intention of fighting it out in the city, after we
have entered the breach. All, I fancy, who can, will be
off as soon as we are within the walls. The General has
not decided yet on the operations which are to succeed
Delhi; he says he shall send a strong column in pursuit,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
which I hope will be under Nicholson, but he has not
settled who is to go, or who to stay. I trust I may be
among the pursuers. I am constantly interrupted by
business, and the necessity of watching the enemy, lest
any attempt should be made to turn our flank while we
are busied with the batteries in front. For myself, I am
not necessarily much exposed to fire, except every now
and then; I never run into danger unless obliged to do
so for some rightful purpose, and where duty and honor
call.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 9th.</i>&mdash;... To descend to life's hard struggle;
our guns are blazing away, but only in partial numbers
as yet, the work having been necessarily distributed over
two nights instead of one. The garrison at Lucknow is
all well, and likely to continue so, for they have plenty
of wheat, though no European supplies. However,
British soldiers have worked and fought on bread and
water ere now, and will do it again; and I have no doubt
the gallant 32d will keep up their spirit and their fame.
Reinforcements were reaching Cawnpore, and Sir J.
Outram was on his way up with 1,500 more soldiers and
some artillery. Cholera, their worst enemy, had disappeared,
and their communication with Calcutta was quite
open. Sir Colin had reached Calcutta, and taken command
of the army. I do hope he will come up country
at once, and Colonel Napier with him. Poor Alfred
Light, after five weeks' severe illness, leaves to-night for
the hills, to save his life. Hay has been written to, to
take him in; if he cannot, I am sure you will do so.
Poor fellow! I have a real regard for him, and it is a
terrible disappointment that he cannot be at the actual
taking of Delhi, having been so long before the walls.
Sickness is terribly on the increase, and Wilson talks of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
getting into Delhi on the 21st. If the sickness does increase
he won't have a sound man left by the 21st.</p>

<p>I was up till 2 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> in the trenches, examining the
work, and helping what little I could,<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and almost ever
since I have been on horseback, and a terrible hot day it
has been in all ways. Some of the enemy's horse came
out and began to poach on our preserves, and I had to go
after them; they are such essential cowards that it is impossible
to bring them to a regular fight; they will not
come from within reach of their shelter, running off at
once to cover, where it would be madness to go after
them. The new batteries did not begin to-day, after all;
they were not quite ready, and the engineers would not
let them open fire.... I am very much pleased
with &mdash;&mdash;'s letter, and rejoice that he is out on an expedition;
the change of air will do him good after that
frightful cholera. His story<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> of the soldier might be
matched by many a rough compliment I get from the
men of the 1st Fusileers; the most genuine perhaps, certainly
the most grateful to my feelings, of any I receive;
a soldier is generally the best and shrewdest judge of an
officer's qualifications.</p>

<p><i>September 11th.</i>&mdash;There is no public news, except that
the batteries are working away at the walls; but our engineers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
have failed terribly in their estimate of the time
required for the works, and all the batteries are even yet
not finished. It is now, however, only a question of days,
one or two more or less, and Delhi must be ours. I shall
be very thankful to get away from here. I look upon
this as the very worst climate I have ever been in, and
another month would make us all ill. Another of my
officers, Captain Ward, is very ill, and two more are ailing.
Macdowell, I am thankful to say, is a little better.
The natives, too, are very sick, and a large number are
in hospital; in short, we want to be in Delhi.</p>

<p><i>September 12th.</i>&mdash;I was interrupted in the midst of my
pen-work this morning by an alarm (which proved to be
a false one) of an attack of cavalry on our rear; it turned
us all out, and kept me in the saddle till now, 5 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>, so
I can only say I am safe and unhurt. I trust in three
days Delhi will be ours. I fancy my share in the assault
will be one of duty rather than of danger. The cavalry
have but small work on these occasions. I cannot yet
tell what will occur after the capture. I fancy a column
under Nicholson will be pushed on to Agra or Cawnpore,
and I hope my regiment will be of the party.</p>

<p><i>September 13th.</i>&mdash;I find I am to accompany Nicholson's
column at his own request, but where we are to go
is unknown; whether in pursuit of the rebels who are
fast evacuating Delhi, or towards Agra, we know not;
Nicholson strongly urges the former. I am very glad for
my own sake that I am to go on, for this place is dreadfully
unhealthy, and I feel that I shall certainly be ill if I
remain here much longer. In fact, I had made up my
mind not to remain if possible, and when Nicholson urged
my going on with him I was only too ready to second the
motion, for I am able to work and to fight, and I must do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
so as long as I can. Some of the Gwalior troops have
crossed the Chumbul River, and are supposed to be
threatening Agra. However, the fall of Delhi will make
every difference in their proceedings, and show them that
we can do something, though so late; we are looking forward
to a little "active service" to-morrow; may God
grant success to our arms, and safety to our brave band
as much as may be.</p>

<p><i>September 15th.</i>&mdash;I was totally unable to leave the
field yesterday until dark, and long after post-time, but I
ascertained that a telegraphic message was sent to Simla.
I sent one up as soon as possible, for transmission to you
through Lord W. Hay, but Colonel Becher had forestalled
me.... The breaches made by our artillery
were successfully stormed early in the morning, with but
little loss then; our loss, subsequently, however, I grieve
to say, was most distressing, and that, in attempting unsuccessfully
the capture of the Puhareepore and Kishengunge
suburbs. The whole extent of our loss is not
yet known, but that already ascertained is grievous to a
degree. First, poor Nicholson most dangerously wounded,
at a time, too, when his services were beyond expression
valuable.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The 1st European Bengal Fusileers was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
the most tried, and suffered out of all proportion, save in
the especial case of the Engineers, of whom ten, out
of the seventeen engaged, have been killed or wounded.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
Chesney and Hovenden among the latter, though not
badly. Of the Fusileers, poor Jacob was mortally wounded,
since dead, I grieve to say; Greville, badly; Owen, severely;
Wemyss and Lambert, slightly; Butler, knocked
down and stunned; F. Brown and Warner, both grazed.
Of officers attached to the regiment, Captain Mac Barnett
was killed; Stafford, wounded; Speke, mortally so; what
a frightful list! Besides this, Captain Boisragon was
wounded badly, with the Kumaon battalion; so that, of
the officers of the 1st Fusileers engaged yesterday, only
Wriford, Wallace, and myself, escaped untouched. My
preservation (I do not like the word escape) was miraculous.
For more than two hours we had to sit on our
horses under the heaviest fire troops are often exposed to,
and that, too, without the chance of doing anything but
preventing the enemy coming on. Brigadier Hope Grant
commanded, and while I doubt his judgment in taking
cavalry into such a position, I admit that it was impossible
for any man to take troops under a hotter fire, keep
them there more steadily, or exhibit a more cool and
determined bravery than he did. My young regiment
behaved admirably, as did all hands. The loss of the
party was of course very severe. Of Tombs's troop
alone, twenty-five men (out of fifty) and seventeen horses
were hit. The brigadier and four officers composing his
staff all had their horses killed, and two of the five were
wounded. The brigadier himself was hit by a spent shot;
Tombs escaped, I am delighted to say, from a similar
spent ball. Our success on the whole was hardly what it
should have been, considering the sacrifice, but the great
end of getting into Delhi was attained. About one third
of the city is in our power, and the remainder will shortly
follow, but that third has cost us between 600 and 700
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
killed and wounded.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> I am most humbly and heartily
grateful to a merciful Providence that I was spared.
May the God of battles continue His gracious protection
to the end, and enable me once more to be reunited to all
most precious to me on earth.

"<span class="smcap">Delhi.</span></p>

<p>"On the night of the 13th September, final preparations
were made for the assault on the city. Brigadiers
and commanding officers (our little army boasts of no
generals of divisions) were summoned to the General's
tent, and then received their instructions. At 1 o'clock
<span class="smcap">a. m.</span> on the 14th, the men all turned out silently, no
bugles or trumpets sounding, and moved down in silence
to the trenches. The batteries all this time kept up an
unceasing fire on the city, which responded to it as usual.
On arriving at the trenches the troops lay down, awaiting
the signal, which was to be given at daybreak, and which
was to be the blowing in of the Cashmere Gate, towards
which a party of Engineers and Sappers moved off at
about 3 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> The assault was to be made in three columns:
the first was to blow open the Cashmere Gate, the
second to escalade the Water Bastion, and the third to
escalade the Moree Bastion, both of which had been pronounced
practicable. As I was with the cavalry all the
time, I saw nothing of the storming, but it is sufficient to
say it succeeded on every point, and by 8 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> we were
inside the walls, and held all their outworks.</p>

<p>"Now began the difficulty, as from the small force we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
had, it was very hard work to drive a large body of men
out of such a city as Delhi. It took four days to accomplish,
but at length, on the morning of the 20th, the flag
of Old England floated gracefully out over the palace of
the Great Mogul. And now for what we (the cavalry)
did. At 3 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span><a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> we moved down in column of squadrons
to the rear of our batteries, and waited there till
about 5 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>, when the enemy advanced from the Lahore
Gate with two troops of artillery, no end of cavalry, and
a lot of infantry, apparently to our front. I think they
intended to try and take our old position now that we had
got theirs. In an instant horse artillery and cavalry
were ordered to the front, and we went there at the gallop,
bang through our own batteries, the gunners cheering
us as we leapt over the sand-bags, &amp;c., and halted under
the Moree Bastion, under as heavy a fire of round shot,
grape, and canister, as I have ever been under in my
life. Our artillery dashed to the front, unlimbered, and
opened upon the enemy, and at it they both went 'hammer
and tongs.' Now you must understand we had no
infantry with us. All the infantry were fighting in the
city. They sent out large bodies of infantry and cavalry
against us, and then began the fire of musketry. It was
tremendous. There we were (9th Lancers, 1st, 2d, 4th
Sikhs, Guide Cavalry, and Hodson's Horse) protecting
the Artillery, who were threatened by their infantry and
cavalry. And fancy what a pleasant position we were
in, under this infernal fire, and never returning a shot.
Our artillery blazed away, of course, but we had to sit
in our saddles and be knocked over. However, I am
happy to say we saved the guns. The front we kept was
so steady as to keep them back until some of the Guide
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
infantry came down and went at them. I have been in a
good many fights now, but always under such a heavy
fire as this with my own regiment, and then there is always
excitement, cheering on your men, who are replying
to the enemy's fire; but here we were in front of a lot of
gardens perfectly impracticable for cavalry, under a fire
of musketry which I have seldom seen equalled, the
enemy quite concealed, and here we had to sit for three
hours. Had we retired, they would at once have taken
our guns. Had the guns retired with us, we should have
lost the position. No infantry could be spared to assist
us, so we had to sit there. Men and horses were knocked
over every minute. We suffered terribly. With my usual
good luck I was never touched. Well, all things must
have an end. Some infantry came down and cleared the
gardens in our front, and as their cavalry never showed,
and we had no opportunity of charging, we fell back, and
(the fire being over in that quarter) halted and dismounted.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
All this time hard fighting was going on in
the city. The next day, and up to the morning of the
19th, we did nothing (I am now speaking exclusively of
the cavalry brigade) but form in line on the top of the
ridge, ready to pursue the enemy should they turn out of
the city in force."<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>

<p>
<i>September 16th.</i>&mdash;I have just returned from a very
long and terribly hot ride of some hours to ascertain the
movements, position, and line of retreat of the enemy,
and I can do no more than report my safety. I grieve
much for poor Major Jacob, we buried him and three
sergeants of the regiment last night; he was a noble
soldier. His death has made me a captain, the long
wished-for goal; but I would rather have served on as
a subaltern than gained promotion thus. Greville and
Owen are doing well, but I much fear there is no hope
for poor Nicholson; his is a cruel wound, and his loss
would be a material calamity. You may count our real
officers on your fingers now&mdash;men, I mean, really worthy
the name. General Wilson is fairly broken down by
fatigue and anxiety, he cannot stand on his legs to-day;
fortunately, Chamberlain is well enough to go down and
keep him straight; and Colonel Seaton also,&mdash;two good
men, if he will be led by them. All is going on well;
the magazine was carried by storm this morning, with
nominal loss, and our guns are knocking the fort and
palace about. All the suburbs have been evacuated or
taken. I have just ridden through them, and all the
enemy's heavy guns have been brought into camp. In
forty-eight hours the whole city, I think, with its seven
miles of <i>enceinte</i>, will be ours; our loss has been very
heavy: 46 officers killed and wounded, 200 men killed,
and 700 or 800 wounded.</p>

<p><i>September 17th.</i>&mdash;All is going on well, though slowly;
the Sepoys still occupy a portion of the city, and are
being gradually driven backwards, while the palace and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
fort are continually played upon by shell and shot; not
above 3,000 or 4,000 of the rebel troops remain in the
city. Head-quarters are there, and I am going down
immediately to take up my quarters with the staff. I
expect to-morrow will see the last of it, but there is no
calculating with anything like certainty on the proceedings
of these unreasoning wretches. I am thankful to say
Nicholson is a little better to-day, and there appears some
hope of his recovery, though a very slight one. Mr.
Colvin is dead: another celebrity taken away in this
time of trial. The home mail of the 10th of August
has arrived, but brought no letters for me as yet, but very
few have arrived in all. The Government at home seem
at last awaking to a sense of the importance of this crisis
in Indian affairs.</p>

<p><i>September 18th.</i>&mdash;There is nothing worth speaking of
doing here. We are still shelling the fort and palace,
but as slowly, alas, as possible. I am writing in great
haste, in order to go down and see my "intelligence"
people. Some of the enemy are trying negotiation. I
only hope they may find it is too late, and that we may
pursue and destroy the wretches whom we have to thank
for so much barbarity and bloodshed.</p>

<p><i>September 19th.</i>&mdash;We are making slow progress in
the city. The fact is, the troops are utterly demoralized
by hard work and hard drink, I grieve to say. For the
first time in my life I have had to see English soldiers
refuse repeatedly to follow their officers. Greville, Jacob,
Nicholson, and Speke were all sacrificed to this. We
were out with all the cavalry this morning on a <i>reconnaissance</i>,
or rather demonstration, for some miles, and
got a wetting for our pains; however, rain at this season
is too grateful to be complained of.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span></p>

<p>
<i>September 20th.</i>&mdash;I have been much shocked (even familiar
as I have become with death) by poor Greathed's<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
sudden death yesterday from cholera; the strongest and
healthiest man in camp snatched away after a few hours'
illness. Sir T. Metcalfe also is very ill with the same
cruel disease; what a harvest of death there has been
during the past four months, as if war was not sufficiently
full of horrors. The rebels have fled from the city in
thousands, and it is all but empty; only the palace is still
occupied, and that we hope to get hold of immediately,
and so this horribly protracted siege will be at an end at
last, thank God. None but those who fought through the
first six weeks of the campaign know on what a thread
our lives and the safety of the Empire hung, or can appreciate
the sufferings and exertions of those days of
watchfulness and combat, of fearful heat and exhaustion,
of trial and danger. I look back on them with a feeling
of almost doubt whether they were real or only a foul
dream. This day will be a memorable one in the annals
of the Empire; the restoration of British rule in the East
dates from the 20th September, 1857.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In the Royal Palace Delhi</span>, <i>September 22d</i>.&mdash;
I was quite unable to write yesterday, having had a hard
day's work. I was fortunate enough to capture the King
and his favorite wife. To-day, more fortunate still, I
have seized and destroyed the King's two sons and a
grandson (the famous, or rather infamous, Abu Bukr),
the villains who ordered the massacre of our women and
children, and stood by and witnessed the foul barbarity;
their bodies are now lying on the spot where those of the
unfortunate ladies were exposed. I am very tired, but
very much satisfied with my day's work, and so seem all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
hands. We were to have accompanied the movable
column, but to-day it is counter-ordered, and we remain
here.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p><i>September 23d.</i>&mdash;When shall I have time to write
really a letter? It seems as if I were each day doomed
to fresh labor and worry, and I long to shake off the
whole coil, and go where I can find repose and peace.
Fortunately, my health stands the wear and tear, and
as my success has been great I must not grumble....
I came to camp this morning to see after the march of a
detachment of my regiment which is ordered, after half
a dozen changes, to accompany a movable column which
is ordered to proceed towards Agra to-morrow. I am to
remain here, and to tell the truth, the business is so mismanaged
that I have ceased to care whether I go or stay.
I fancy they find me too useful here. We move down
bodily to or near the town to-morrow, and everything is
in confusion and bustle.</p>

<p><i>September 24th.</i>&mdash;Brigadier Grant, like dear Sir
Henry Lawrence, (though both married men themselves,)
says that soldiers have no business to marry; under the
idea that anxiety for their wives' welfare and safety often
induces men to hesitate to run risks which they would
otherwise cheerfully undergo. I, on a less selfish principle,
question very much whether men have any right to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
expose their wives to such misery and anxiety as during
the last few months have fallen to the lot of so many;
and yet it seems hard to say that soldiers, who have so
much to endure at times for the sake of others and of
their common country, should be denied the happiness of
married life, because times of danger will sometimes occur,
and certain I am that the love of a noble-hearted
woman nerves one's arm to daring and to honor. Happy,
however, is the woman whose husband is not a soldier.... Really
the rumors which travel about are too
ludicrous, though hardly more so than those which take
rise and are actually believed in camp.</p>

<p>The true account of the cavalry "demonstration" is
this: on the morning on which the city and palace were
finally evacuated (19th), the whole of the available cavalry
(not otherwise employed) moved out through the suburbs
in the direction of, though not on the road to, the
Kootub, but with strict orders not to go under fire! Well,
we all marched out to the top of the hill on which stands
the "Eedgah," and thence, from a safe and respectful
distance, overlooked the camp of the Bareilly and Nusseerabad
force, under "General" Bukt Khan, quondam
Subadar of artillery. While minutely examining the
camp through my glass (I was with Brigadier Hope
Grant, to show the way), I perceived, by unmistakable
signs, that it was being evacuated. Shortly after a loud
explosion showed that they were blowing up their ammunition
previous to a flight; these signs were on the moment
confirmed by the arrival of my "Hurkaras" (messengers),
and I immediately got leave to go and tell the
General. I did so, galloping down along the front of the
city to see if that was quite clear. I then asked leave to
go down through the camp, and see what was really the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
state of the case; and Macdowell and I started with
seventy-five men, and rode at a gallop right round the
city to the Delhi gate, clearing the roads of plunderers
and suspicious-looking objects as we went. We found the
camp as I had been told, empty, and the Delhi gate open;
we were there at 11 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> at latest, and it was not until
2 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> that the order was given for the cavalry to move
out, and they were so long about it, that when at sunset
Macdowell and I were returning, (bringing away three
guns left by the enemy, and having made arrangements
and collected camels for bringing in the empty tents, &amp;c.,)
we met the advance-guard coming slowly forward in
grand array! We had been on to the jail and old fort,
two or three miles beyond Delhi, and executed many a
straggler. I brought in the mess plate of the 60th Native
Infantry, their standards, drums, and other things.
Macdowell and I had been for five hours inside the Delhi
gate, hunting about, before a guard was sent to take
charge of it.</p>

<p>The next day I got permission, after much argument
and entreaty, to go and bring in the King, for which
(though negotiations for his life had been entertained) no
provision had been made and no steps taken, and his
favorite wife also, and the young imp (her son) whom he
had destined to succeed him on the throne. This was
successfully accomplished, at the expense of vast fatigue
and no trifling risk.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> I then set to work to get hold of
the villain princes. It was with the greatest difficulty
that the General was persuaded to allow them to be
interfered with, till even poor Nicholson roused himself
to urge that the pursuit should be attempted. The General
at length yielded a reluctant consent, adding "but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
don't let me be bothered with them." I assured him it
was nothing but his own order which "bothered" him
with the King, as I would much rather have brought him
into Delhi dead than living. Glad to have at length
obtained even this consent, I prepared for my dangerous
expedition. Macdowell accompanied me, and taking one
hundred picked men, I started early for the tomb of
the Emperor Humayoon, where the villains had taken
sanctuary. I laid my plans so as to cut off access to
the tomb or escape from it, and then sent in one of the
inferior scions of the royal family (purchased for the
purpose by the promise of his life) and my one-eyed
Moulvie Rujub Alee, to say that I had come to seize the
Shahzadahs for punishment, and intended to do so, dead
or alive. After two hours of wordy strife and very anxious
suspense, they appeared, and asked if their lives had
been promised by the Government, to which I answered
"most certainly not," and sent them away from the tomb
towards the city, under a guard. I then went with the
rest of the sowars to the tomb, and found it crowded with,
I should think, some 6,000 or 7,000 of the servants, hangers-on,
and scum of the palace and city, taking refuge in
the cloisters which lined the walls of the tomb. I saw at
a glance that there was nothing for it but determination
and a bold front, so I demanded in a voice of authority
the instant surrender of their arms, &amp;c. They immediately
obeyed, with an alacrity I scarcely dared to hope
for, and in less than two hours they brought forth from
innumerable hiding-places some 500 swords, and more
than that number of fire-arms, besides horses, bullocks,
and covered carts called "Ruths," used by the women
and eunuchs of the palace. I then arranged the arms
and animals in the centre, and left an armed guard with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
them, while I went to look after my prisoners, who, with
their guard, had moved on towards Delhi. I came up
just in time, as a large mob had collected, and were turning
on the guard. I rode in among them at a gallop, and
in a few words I appealed to the crowd, saying that these
were the butchers who had murdered and brutally used
helpless women and children, and that the Government
had now sent their punishment: seizing a carabine from
one of my men, I deliberately shot them one after another.
I then ordered the bodies to be taken into the
city, and thrown out on the "Chiboutra," in front of the
Kotwalie,<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> where the blood of their innocent victims still
could be distinctly traced. The bodies remained before
the Kotwalie until this morning, when, for sanitary reasons,
they were removed. In twenty-four hours, therefore,
I disposed of the principal members of the house
of Timur the Tartar. I am not cruel, but I confess I
did rejoice at the opportunity of ridding the earth of these
wretches. I intended to have had them hung, but when
it came to a question of "they" or "us," I had no time
for deliberation.</p>

<p><i>September 24th.</i>&mdash;The picture drawn from the usually
mendacious reports at Simla, is not even founded on
fact. The women of the palace had all escaped before
the troops entered.</p>

<p>The troops have behaved with singular moderation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
towards women and children, considering their provocation.
I do not believe, and I have some means of knowing,
that a single woman or child has been purposely
injured by our troops, and the story on which your righteous
indignation is grounded is quite false; the troops
have been demoralized by drink, but nothing more.</p>

<p><i>September 25th.</i>&mdash;... I miss Colonel Seaton terribly,
we have lived in the same tent for months, and had become
brothers in affection as well as in arms. I mourn
deeply for poor Nicholson; with the single exceptions
of my ever-revered Sir Henry Lawrence, and Colonel
Mackeson, I have never seen his equal in field or council;
he was pre&euml;minently our "best and bravest," and
his loss is not to be atoned for in these days. I cannot
help being pleased with the warm congratulations I receive
on all sides for my success in destroying the enemies
of our race; the whole nation will rejoice, but I am
pretty sure that however glad &mdash;&mdash; will be at their destruction,
he will take exception to my having been the
instrument, in God's hands, of their punishment. That
will not signify, however; I am too conscious of the
rectitude of my own motives to care what the few may
say while my own conscience and the voice of the many
pronounce me right.
</p>
</div>

<p>A fuller account of the capture of the King will
be found in a letter addressed to me shortly afterwards,
and published by me in the <i>Times</i>, which
I now reprint:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"I have before explained to you what your brother's
(Captain Hodson's) position officially was,&mdash;namely, that
he was appointed Assistant Quartermaster-General and
Intelligence Officer on the Commander-in-Chief's own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
Staff. His reports were to be made to him direct, without
the intervention of the Quartermaster-General or any
other person.</p>

<p>"For this appointment, which was then a most responsible
one, as intelligence of the enemy's movements and
intentions was of the utmost importance, his long acquaintance
with Sikhs and Affghans, and his having been similarly
employed in the Punjaub war, had peculiarly fitted
him. Of course, there were always plenty of traitors in
the enemy's camp ready to sell their own fathers for gain,
or to avoid punishment, and he was invested with full
power to promise reward or punishment, in proportion to
the deserts of those who assisted him.</p>

<p>"On our taking possession of the city gate, reports
came in that thousands of the enemy were evacuating
the city by the other gates, and that the King also had
left his palace. We fought our way inch by inch to the
palace walls, and then found truly enough that its vast
arena was void. The very day after we took possession
of the palace, (the 20th,) Captain Hodson received information
that the King and his family had gone with a
large force out of the Ajmere Gate to the Kootub. He
immediately reported this to the General commanding,
and asked whether he did not intend to send a detachment
in pursuit, as with the King at liberty and heading
so large a force, our victory was next to useless, and we
might be besieged instead of besiegers. General Wilson
replied that he could not spare a single European. He
then volunteered to lead a party of the Irregulars, but
this offer was also refused, though backed up by Neville
Chamberlain.</p>

<p>"During this time messengers were coming in constantly,
and among the rest one from Zeenat Mahal, (the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
favorite Begum,) with an offer to use her influence with
the King to surrender on certain conditions. These conditions
at first were ludicrous enough&mdash;viz: that the King
and the whole of the males of his family should be
restored to his palace and honors; that not only should
his pension be continued, but the arrears since May be
paid up, with several other equally modest demands. I
need not say these were treated with contemptuous denial.
Negotiations, however, were vigorously carried on, and
care was taken to spread reports of an advance in force
to the Kootub. Every report as it came in was taken to
General Wilson, who at last gave orders to Captain Hodson
to promise the King's life and freedom from personal
indignity, and make what other terms he could. Captain
Hodson then started with only fifty of his own men for
Humayoon's Tomb, three miles from the Kootub, where
the King had come during the day. The risk was such as
no one can judge of, who has not seen the road,<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> amid
the old ruins scattered about of what was once the real
city of Delhi.</p>

<p>"He concealed himself and men in some old buildings
close by the gateway of the Tomb, and sent in his two
emissaries to Zeenat Mahal with the <i>ultimatum</i>,&mdash;the
King's life and that of her son and father (the latter has
since died). After two hours passed by Captain Hodson
in most trying suspense, such as (he says) he never spent
before, while waiting the decision, his emissaries (one an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
old favorite of poor Sir Henry Lawrence,) came out with
the last offer&mdash;that the King would deliver himself up
to Captain Hodson only, and on condition that he repeated
with his own lips the promise of the Government for his
safety.</p>

<p>"Captain Hodson then went out into the middle of the
road in front of the gateway, and said that he was ready
to receive his captives and renew the promise.</p>

<p>"You may picture to yourself the scene before that
magnificent gateway, with the milk-white domes of the
Tomb towering up from within, one white man among a
host of natives, yet determined to secure his prisoner or
perish in the attempt.</p>

<p>"Soon a procession began to come slowly out, first
Zeenat Mahal, in one of the close native conveyances
used for women. Her name was announced as she
passed by the Moulvie. Then came the King in a palkee,
on which Captain Hodson rode forward and demanded
his arms. Before giving them up, the King asked
whether he was 'Hodson Bahadoor,' and if he would
repeat the promise made by the herald? Captain Hodson
answered that he would, and repeated that the Government
had been graciously pleased to promise him his
life, and that of Zeenat Mahal's son, on condition of his
yielding himself prisoner quietly, adding very emphatically,
that if any attempt was made at a rescue he would
shoot the King down on the spot like a dog. The old
man then gave up his arms, which Captain Hodson
handed to his orderly, still keeping his own sword drawn
in his hand. The same ceremony was then gone through
with the boy (Jumma Bukh); and the march towards
the city began, the longest five miles, as Captain Hodson
said, that he ever rode, for of course the palkees only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
went at a foot pace, with his handful of men around them,
followed by thousands, any one of whom could have shot
him down in a moment. His orderly told me that it was
wonderful to see the influence which his calm and undaunted
look had on the crowd. They seemed perfectly
paralyzed at the fact of one white man (for they thought
nothing of his fifty black sowars) carrying off their King
alone. Gradually as they approached the city the crowd
slunk away, and very few followed up to the Lahore gate.
Then Captain Hodson rode on a few paces and ordered
the gate to be opened. The officer on duty asked simply
as he passed what he had got in his palkees. 'Only the
King of Delhi,' was the answer, on which the officer's
enthusiastic exclamation was more emphatic than becomes
ears polite. The guard were for turning out to
greet him with a cheer, and could only be repressed, on
being told that the King would take the honor to himself.
They passed up that magnificent deserted street to the
palace gate, where Capt. Hodson met the civil officer (Mr.
Saunders), and formally delivered over his Royal prisoners
to him. His remark was amusing, 'By Jove! Hodson,
they ought to make you Commander-in-Chief for this.'</p>

<p>"On proceeding to the General's quarters to report his
successful return, and hand over the Royal arms, he was
received with the characteristic speech, 'Well, I'm glad
you have got him, but I never expected to see either him
or you again!' while the other officers in the room were
loud in their congratulations and applause. He was requested
to select for himself from the Royal arms what
he chose, and has therefore two magnificent swords, one
with the name of 'Nadir Shah,' and the other the seal
of Jehan Gire engraved upon it, which he intends to
present to the Queen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span></p>

<p>"On the following day, as you already know, he captured
three of the Princes; but of this more hereafter.
I am anxious now that you should fully understand that
your brother was bound by orders from the General to
spare the King's life, much against his own will; that the
capture alone was on his own risk and responsibility, and
not the pledge."<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
</p>
</div>

<p>I am allowed to insert here a most graphic letter,
written by Lieut. Macdowell, 2d in command
of Hodson's Horse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"On the morning of the 19th we formed up and saw
the townspeople coming in thousands out of the Delhi
gate (still in the enemy's possession), and passing through
their camp, taking the high road to the Kootub. Too
far off to do any damage, we waited (the ground a mass
of hard rocks, impracticable for cavalry) till 9 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>, and
then retired. Hodson, my commanding officer, then
went to the General, and at ten I received a note from
him, 'Gallop down with fifty men and meet me at the
Cashmere gate as sharp as possible.' Down I went, and
he told me he had volunteered to ride through the enemy's
camp and reconnoitre; that no one knew if they
were there in force or not, and he asked me if I would
accompany him. Of course I was only too glad, and off
we went. They fired at us as we approached, from gardens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
and places all round, but I imagine they thought
more men were coming, and bolted, we (only fifty of us)
cutting up all their stragglers to the tune of some fifty or
sixty. As we came back we intercepted a whole lot of
townspeople escaping. Well, I must not linger on this.
Having done our work (and it wasn't a bad thing to do,
to gallop through their camp with fifty men, not knowing
whether they were there or not), we cautiously approached
the Delhi gate. It was open, but all was silent.
Our troops had not as yet ventured so far. Afar off we
heard the firing in the city in other quarters; leaving
our men outside, with four Sowars behind us with cocked
carabines, we rode in, holding our revolvers ready for a
row. Not a soul was there; all still as death. I looked
round, and close to where I was sitting were two bottles
of beer amidst a heap of plate, silver, clothes, &amp;c. Perhaps
I didn't jump off sharp! It was all right; real
beer! madam; we uncorked, and drank the Queen's
health at once. After a little time, as the firing approached,
and we found all was right, we rode away, and
reported what we had done. The General was very
pleased.</p>

<p>"And now for my great adventure. On the 20th the
King gave himself up, and was lodged securely in Delhi
under a guard. On this day all had evacuated the place,
of which we were complete masters. On the 21st a note
from Hodson, 'Come sharp, bring one hundred men.'
Off I went, time 6 o'clock <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> To explain why he
wrote to me, I must tell you that although he commanded
the regiment, he was also the head of the Intelligence
Department, and lived in the General's quarters, while I
lived with the regiment, commanding it in his absence,
as being second in command. Well, down I went. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
told me he had heard that the three Princes<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> (the heads
of the rebellion and sons of the King) were in a tomb
six miles off, and he intended going to bring them, and
offered me the chance of accompanying him. Wasn't it
handsome on his part! Of course I went; we started
at about eight o'clock, and proceeded slowly towards the
tomb. It is called Humayoon's Tomb, and is an immense
building. In it were the princes and about 3,000 Mussulman
followers. In the suburb close by about 3,000
more, all armed, so it was rather a ticklish bit of work.
We halted half a mile from the place, and sent in to say
the princes must give themselves up unconditionally, or
take the consequences. A long half hour elapsed, when
a messenger came out to say the princes wished to know
if their lives would be promised them, if they came out.
'Unconditional surrender,' was the answer. Again we
waited. It was a most anxious time. We dared not
take them by force, or all would have been lost, and
we doubted their coming. We heard the shouts of the
fanatics (as we found out afterwards) begging the princes
to lead them on against us. And we had only one hundred
men, and were six miles from Delhi. At length,
I suppose, imagining that sooner or later they must be
taken, they resolved to give themselves up unconditionally,
fancying, I suppose, as we had spared the King, we
would spare them. So the messenger was sent to say
they were coming. We sent ten men to meet them, and
by Hodson's order I drew the troop up across the road,
ready to receive them, and shoot them at once if there
was any attempt at a rescue. Soon they appeared in a
small 'Ruth' or Hindostanee cart drawn by bullocks,
five troopers on each side. Behind them thronged about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
2,000 or 3,000 (I am not exaggerating) Mussulmans.
We met them, and at once Hodson and I rode up, leaving
the men a little in the rear. They bowed as we
came up, and Hodson, bowing, ordered the driver to
move on. This was the minute. The crowd behind
made a movement. Hodson waved them back; I beckoned
to the troop, which came up, and in an instant
formed them up between the crowd and the cart. By
Hodson's order I advanced at a walk on the people, who
fell back sullenly and slowly at our approach. It was
touch and go. Meanwhile Hodson galloped back, and
told the sowars (10) to hurry the princes on along the
road, while we showed a front and kept back the mob.
They retired on Humayoon's Tomb, and step by step
we followed them. Inside they went up the steps, and
formed up in the immense garden inside. The entrance
to this was through an arch, up steps. Leaving the men
outside, Hodson and myself (I stuck to him throughout),
with four men, rode up the steps into the arch,<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> when he
called out to them to lay down their arms. There was a
murmur. He reiterated the command, and (God knows
why, I never can understand it) they commenced doing
so. Now you see we didn't want their arms, and under
ordinary circumstances would not have risked our lives
in so rash a way, but what we wanted was to gain time
to get the princes away, for we could have done nothing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
had they attacked us, but cut our way back, and very
little chance of doing even this successfully. Well, there
we stayed for two hours, collecting their arms, and I
assure you I thought every moment they would rush
upon us. I said nothing, but smoked all the time, to
show I was unconcerned; but at last, when it was all
done, and all the arms collected, put in a cart, and started,
Hodson turned to me and said, 'We'll go, now.' Very
slowly we mounted, formed up the troop, and cautiously
departed, followed by the crowd. We rode along quietly.
You will say, why did we not charge them? I merely
say, we were one hundred men, and they were fully
6,000. I am not exaggerating; the official reports will
show you it is all true. As we got about a mile off, Hodson
turned to me and said, 'Well, Mac, we've got them
at last;' and we both gave a sigh of relief. Never in
my life, under the heaviest fire, have I been in such imminent
danger. Everybody says it is the most dashing
and daring thing that has been done for years (not on
my part, for I merely obeyed orders, but on Hodson's,
who planned and carried it out). Well, I must finish my
story. We came up to the princes, now about five miles
from where we had taken them, and close to Delhi. The
increasing crowd pressed close on the horses of the sowars,
and assumed every moment a more hostile appearance.
'What shall we do with them?' said Hodson to me. 'I
think we had better shoot them here; we shall never get
them in.'</p>

<p>"We had identified them by means of a nephew of the
King's whom we had with us, and who turned King's evidence.
Besides, they acknowledged themselves to be the
men. Their names were Mirza Mogul, the King's nephew
and head of the whole business; Mirza Kishere Sultamet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
who was also one of the principal rebels, and had
made himself notorious by murdering women and children;
and Abu Bukt, the commander-in-chief nominally,
and heir-apparent to the throne. This was the young
fiend who had stripped our women in the open street, and
cutting off little children's arms and legs, poured the
blood into their mothers' mouths; this is literally the
case. There was no time to be lost; we halted the
troop, put five troopers across the road behind and in
front. Hodson ordered the Princes to strip and get again
into the cart; he then shot them with his own hand. So
ended the career of the chiefs of the revolt, and of the
greatest villains that ever shamed humanity. Before
they were shot, Hodson addressed our men, explaining
who they were, and why they were to suffer death; the
effect was marvellous, the Mussulmans seemed struck
with a wholesome idea of retribution, and the Sikhs
shouted with delight, while the mass moved off slowly
and silently. One of the sowars pointed out to me a
man running rapidly across a piece of cultivated ground,
with arms gleaming in the sunlight. I and the sowar
rode after him, when I discovered it was the King's favorite
eunuch, of whose atrocities we had heard so much.
The sowar cut him down instantly, and we returned, well
satisfied that we had rid the world of such a monster.
It was now four o'clock; Hodson rode into the city with
the cart containing the bodies, and had them placed in
the most public street, where all might see them. Side
by side they lay where, four months before, on the same
spot, they had outraged and murdered our women. I
went quietly home with the troop, nearly dead, having
had nothing (except water) since six o'clock the previous
night. I have not time to write you of my subsequent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
adventures, but will next mail. We have gained a great
deal of <span class="greek" title="kudos">&#954;&#8166;&#948;&#959;&#962;</span> for this business, and I hear are to be rewarded
in some way or other."
</p>
</div>

<p>Some months later my brother wrote with reference
to this matter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left25">
<span class="smcap">Camp, on the left bank of the Ganges,
opposite Cawnpore</span>,<br />
<span class="i4"><i>Feb. 12th, 1858</i>.</span></p>

<p>... I see that many people suppose that I had promised
the old King his life <i>after</i> he was caught. Pray
contradict this. The promise was given two days before,
to induce him to leave the rebel troops and return to
the near neighborhood of Delhi within reach. General
Wilson refused to send troops in pursuit of him, and to
avoid greater calamities I then, and not till then, asked
and obtained permission to offer him his wretched life, on
the ground, and solely on the ground, that there was
no other way of getting him into our possession. The
people were gathering round him. His name would
have been a tocsin which would have raised the whole of
Hindostan, and the Rajahs and Rajpootana in the south
would have been forced to have joined in the rising,
which would then have been universal. Was it not
better to get rid of all this, and secure ourselves from
further mischief at the simple cost of sparing the life of
an old man of ninety? It must be remembered, too, that
we had no troops left to meet any further augmentation
of our enemies. A small force under Colonel Greathed
was with difficulty found, some days later, to go towards
Agra; and it was clear to me then (as experience has
since shown) that we had still months to wait for reinforcements
from home. Here is February; the King
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
was caught in September, and yet up to this present day
the Commander-in-Chief has not been able to send a
single soldier of all that have arrived from England up
as far as Delhi; and all Rohilcund, all Oude, a great
part of Central India, all Bundelcund, and most of
Behar, are still in the hands of the enemy. Would it
have been wise to have given, in addition to all this, so
strong an incentive to combination, to the warlike men of
the northwest, as they would have had in the person of
a sacred and "heaven-born" monarch, dethroned, wandering,
and homeless, but backed by a whole army in
rebellion? I am blamed for it now; but knowing that

there was no other way of getting him into our power, I
am quite content to take the obloquy. It will hereafter
be admitted that one of the greatest blows was struck at
the root of the rebellion when the old King was led a
captive into his own palace on the 21st of September,
1857.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Strange, that some of those who are loudest
against me for sparing the King, are also crying out at
my destroying his sons. "Quousque tandem?" I may
well exclaim. But in point of fact, I am quite indifferent
to clamor either way. I made up my mind at the time
to be abused. I was convinced I was right, and when I
prepared to run the great physical risk of the attempt, I
was equally game for the moral risk of praise or blame.
These have not been, and are not times when a man who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
would serve his country dare hesitate as to the personal
consequences to himself of what he thinks his duty.
</p>
</div>

<p>I am indebted to Sir T. Seaton for an answer
to inquiries addressed to my brother, which never
reached him:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"I see you are anxious to clear up the two 'vexed
questions:'&mdash;Why did he guarantee the life of the King?
Why did he strip the princes? He guaranteed the life
of the King, because he was ordered to do so by General
Wilson; and I think that under the circumstances it was
wise and prudent (though highly distasteful to the General),
for it enabled us to get hold of the nominal head of
the great rebellion, and to secure the capture of those
greater scoundrels, the princes. No one ever thought
out here of asking why he stripped the princes, or rather
why he made them take off their upper garments. It
certainly was not as the French stupidly assert, 'pour ne
pas g&acirc;ter le butin,' for if the upper corresponded with
the nether clothes in which the bodies were laid out, they
would have been dear at a shilling the lot. He made
them strip off their upper garments, to render their death
and subsequent exposure at the Kotw&agrave;lla more impressive
and terrible. Some people ask, 'Why did he shoot
them himself?' To this I will reply by another question,
'What would have been the effect on that vast
crowd of a single moment's hesitation or appearance of
hesitation?'"
</p>

<p>Before this chapter closes, I will insert one or
two anecdotes and descriptions of my brother,
from letters written at this time by officers before
Delhi, which have been kindly placed at my disposal.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
They will help to fill up the picture of
him, which may be drawn from his own diary.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>One says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"The way Hodson used to work was quite miraculous.
He was a slighter man and lighter weight than I am.
Then he had that most valuable gift, of being able to get
refreshing sleep on horseback. I have been out with him
all night following and watching the enemy, when he has
gone off dead asleep, waking up after an hour as fresh
as a lark; whereas, if I went to sleep in the saddle, the
odds were I fell off on my nose.</p>

<p>"He was the very perfection of a 'free-lance,' and
such an Intelligence Officer! He used to know what the
rebels had for dinner in Delhi.</p>

<p>"In a fight he was glorious. If there was only a good
hard skrimmage he was as happy as a king. A beautiful
swordsman, he never failed to kill his man; and the way
he used to play with the most brave and furious of these
rebels was perfect. I fancy I see him now, smiling,
laughing, parrying most fearful blows, as calmly as if he
were brushing off flies, calling out all the time, 'Why,
try again, now,' 'What's that?' 'Do you call yourself a
swordsman?' &amp;c.</p>

<p>"The way that in a pursuit he used to manage his hog-spear
was miraculous. It always seemed to me that he
bore a charmed life, and so the enemy thought.</p>

<p>"His judgment was as great as his courage, and the
heavier the fire or the greater the difficulty, the more
calm and reflecting he became."
</p>
</div>

<p>Another (Sir T. Seaton):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"You know that, during the whole of the terrible siege
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
of Delhi, we lived together in the same tent, and, excepting
while on duty, we were never separate. It was there
I saw, in all their splendor, his noble soldierly qualities;
never fatigued, never downcast, always cool and calm,
with a cheerful countenance and a word of encouragement
for every one.</p>

<p>"I used often to say, 'Here, Hodson, is somebody
else coming for comfort.'</p>

<p>"It was there I learned the depth and intensity of his
affection for his wife; like the man, it was out of the
common. You know how he nursed me when I was
wounded. I am indebted for my rapid recovery, in a
very great measure, to his care and forethought; and it
was whilst lying helpless and feeble I saw that the brave
and stern soldier had also the tenderness of a woman in
his noble heart. His constant care was to prevent Mrs.
Hodson from feeling any anxiety that he could save her;
so that, whenever he went out on any expedition that
would detain him beyond twenty-four hours, he invariably
asked me, and I used to make it my duty, to write to
Mrs. Hodson daily, accounting for his absence and giving
such details as I could of his doings.</p>

<p>"He was ever ready to carry out my wishes and aid
me with his best knowledge, skill, and courage. He supported
me with the devotion of a brother; never, never
shall I see his like again."
</p>
</div>

<p>Another says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"He has wonderful tact in getting information out of
the natives, and divining the movements of the enemy.
He is scarcely out of the saddle day or night, for not only
has he to lead his regiment and keep the country clear,
but being Intelligence Officer, he is always on the move
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
to gain news of the progress of affairs, and acts and
intentions of the enemy.</p>

<p>"Even when he might take rest he will not, but will
go and help work at the batteries, and expose himself
constantly, in order to relieve some fainting gunner or
wounded man."
</p>
</div>

<p>I have this anecdote from another:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"In the camp at Delhi, when the incessant fatigue to
which the soldiers were exposed forbade the strict enforcement
of the continual salute, it was remarked that
Hodson never passed down the lines without every man
rendering to him that mark of respect. The soldiers
loved him as their own. 'There goes that 'ere Hodson,'
said a drunken soldier as he cantered down the lines;
'he's sure to be in everything; he'll get shot, I know he
will, and I'd a deal rather be shot myself; we can't do
without him.'"
</p>
</div>

<p>I venture to quote from Mr. H. Greathed's Letters
(published by his widow) some further notices
of my brother:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Hodson keeps an Argus eye on the rear and left
flank, and is always ready for an adventurous ride. I
am not surprised at Gough liking him; he has a rare gift
of brains as well as of pluck! The uniform of his men,
'khakee' tunics, with a scarlet sash and turban, is very
picturesque.</p>

<p>"Hodson is certainly the most wide-awake soldier in
camp.</p>

<p>"A charge of cavalry was turned by a few musket shots
from a party under Hodson, who always turns up in moments
of difficulty."</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span></p>

<p>Again, speaking of him while absent at Rohtuck,
August 19th:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"We have no further intelligence from Hodson. He
is employed on just the wild work he likes, and will be
loth to return. The public still amuses itself with giving
his regiment new names, 'the Aloobokharas' and Ring-tailed
Roarers' are the last I have heard of.</p>

<p>... "There was some alarm yesterday about Hodson's
safety. I cannot say I shared the feeling, I have
such confidence in his audacity and resource.</p>

<p>... "Hodson is quite safe, he will now return to
camp, and after being in for an hour, he will be seen
looking as fresh, clean-shaved, and spruce, as if he had
never left it."

<span class="smcap">Camp, Delhi</span>, <i>Sept. 26th</i>.</p>

<p>My letters are of necessity short and newsless, for I am
scarcely ever able to sit down to write what can be properly
called a letter. Anything so mismanaged as the
prize property has been, or so wasted, I never saw; so
much so, that I look upon the appointment of prize agents
at all as a simple injustice to the army, <i>i.e.</i>, to the officers.
Colonel Seaton has given up the prize agency in disgust,
and I refused it altogether; he is taking you a real trophy
from Delhi, no less than the turquoise armlet and signet
rings of the rascally princes whom I shot; not actually
worth twenty shillings, but I know they will be prized by
you and the dear ones at home. Tombs declares I shall
get a C. B. for capturing the King, &amp;c., and, between
ourselves, I <i>ought</i> to have anything they can give me, for
it was a fearful risk, and, I must say, the "General's"
share in it was about as meritorious as his recognition of
the service was gracious! but you will see <i>he</i> will get the
reward; but never mind, I did my duty, perhaps something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
more, and have got the reward of my own conscience,
and certainly the voice of the army, as the hero
of this "crowning mercy," as they call it.</p>

<p>We march to-morrow instead of on the 20th, as we
ought to have done, to clear out some of the hordes at
Humayoon's Tomb. I disarmed them when I took the
princes, and collected all the arms, &amp;c., into one spot,
leaving as large a guard as I could spare, and yet the
"General" has actually never sent until to-day to relieve
the one or secure the other, and now only at my urgent
representation! We shall be back from our expedition
in four or five days. Colonel Showers commands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camp, Humayoon's Tomb</span>, <i>Sept. 28th</i>.&mdash;I have been
out all day and at work, varied by divers summonses
from the Brigadier, and by such <i>very</i> amusing duties
as packing off the royal family's lower branches into
Delhi.</p>

<p>Poor Greathed! he was, indeed, a loss to every one!
With the column sent out here (to complete with 1,500
men the work of which I had overcome all the difficulties
with 100), a young civilian was sent to carry on
political duties, and take charge of the different members
and hangers-on of the Royal family. In an hour I
had got possession of the persons of seven of the remaining
sons and grandsons of the King who were "wanted;"
they were made over, according to orders, to this civilian,
and, two hours afterwards, all had escaped! In consequence
of this we are halted here, and parties sent out in
all directions to recapture the fugitives.</p>

<p>I shall try to get down in the Oudh direction to join
Napier and his chief.</p>

<p>I confess I am much gratified by the congratulations I
receive on all sides regarding the capture of the King
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
and the retribution on the Shahzadahs; but I expect no
reward, perhaps not even thanks. The Government will
be delighted at the fact, but will perhaps pretend a reluctance
to the judgment having been effected, which they
certainly do not feel, and will probably throw all the <i>onus</i>
on me. To tell the truth (in spite of all the praises and
prophecies of the army), I expect nothing by this campaign
but my brevet majority, and that was due to me for
the Punjaub war.</p>

<p>The execution of the princes could be hardly called
one of "unresisting" enemies, since they were surrounded
by an armed host, to whom we should have been most
unquestionably sacrificed if I had hesitated for an instant.
It was <i>they</i> or <i>we</i>, and I recommend those who might
cavil at my choice to go and catch the next rebels themselves!
The King was very old and infirm, and had
long been a mere tool, a name in the hands of the Shahzadahs,
Mirza Mogul in particular; moreover, the orders
I received were such that I did not dare to act on the
dictates of my own judgment to the extent of killing him
when he had given himself up; but had he attempted
either a flight or a rescue, I should have shot him down
like a dog; as it is, he is the lion without his claws, now
his villanous heir-apparent is disposed of. I must be
prepared to have all kinds of bad motives attributed to
me, for no man ever yet went out of the beaten track
without being wondered at and abused; and so marked a
success will make me more enemies than friends, so be
prepared for abuse rather than reward; for myself I
do not care, and I am proud to say that those whose opinion
I value most highly think I did well and boldly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camp near the Kootub</span>, <i>Sept. 29th</i>.&mdash;We got here
so late to-day, that, before our tents were pitched and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
washing and breakfast over, the time to close our d&acirc;k has
arrived. Thanks for letters, which are balm to my
wounded spirit, vexed as I am to find that even here,
in the field, working as I have done, and successful as I
have been, I am not safe from the malignant influence of
&mdash;&mdash; and his myrmidons. From the day that he put &mdash;&mdash;
into power at Delhi, I experienced a difficulty never
found before in carrying on my duties, and a system of
backbiting and insinuation which could never have existed,
if it had not been encouraged, if not engendered,
by listening to. This meanness <i>et id genus omne</i> has
commenced, and has decided me on the course you have
so long urged, namely, to give up the Intelligence Department.</p>

<p>I have done quite enough to establish my name in the
army, and as much as one man can do. We return to
Delhi, I hope, to-morrow, for we have done little enough
by leaving it. The other column, which went out across
the Jumna, has had an engagement with the enemy at
Bolundshur, and thrashed them soundly. This will open
the road to Cawnpore. I shall write to Napier to-day,
to see if he can get my regiment sent towards Oudh, or
anywhere near him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camp, Delhi</span>, <i>Oct. 1st</i>.&mdash;I was quite unable to write
yesterday, as we did not return here and get under cover
till after dark. I have to march again to-morrow towards
Rewarree with another column under Brigadier Showers,
a most gentlemanly person and gallant soldier, but sadly
prolix and formal in all his arrangements, thereby spinning
out an ordinary march to the dimensions of a day's
journey. I am sorry to say my unlucky ankle gives me
more pain and annoyance than before, and the doctors
tell me it will never be better until I give it <i>perfect rest</i>;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
and as this said rest is perfectly impossible, I must bear
it as patiently as I can; but it is a sad drawback to my
comfort and activity.</p>

<p>You will rejoice with me that the detachment (of Hodson's
Horse) under Hugh Gough, who were sent with
the column across the Jumna, behaved extremely well in
that action at Bolundshur, and have been much praised.
I am very glad, indeed, of this; it is a great thing for a
new regiment to be successful at a cheap rate in its first
few encounters; it gives a <i>prestige</i> which it is long in
losing, and gives the men confidence in themselves and
their leaders. In this affair our loss was trifling, though
the cavalry were principally employed. Poor Sarel, 9th
Lancers, wounded severely, I am sorry to say. I fancy
<i>we</i> go to Goorgaon and Rewarree. Whether we see the
enemy is doubtful, and it may be merely a "military
promenade," to settle the minds of the inhabitants. I
long to get down towards Outram, and Oudh, and Napier.</p>

<p>I am so glad you have written home, for I was out of
the way when the "Overland mail" left, and we none of
us knew of its being dispatched. It was a sad fatality
which attended the two last, both from and to England.
England! How the writing the very name even fills me
with sweet home memories and home longings; and
though, during the last five years and three quarters, my
life has been more blessed than I ever dreamed it possible
that life could be, still there are times, and they increase
in frequency, when my heart yearns for all its
dear earlier ties. Yes, we must get home next year,
somehow, even if we have to live on barley bannocks.</p>

<p>I, and most other people, considered that I and my
party had a right to all we found on the King and
princes; but the General, to whom I referred the question,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
thought otherwise; so I gave up all except some of
the personal arms of the princes (those of the King were
taken by the General). The swords which I secured,
thanks to the officers assembled when the arms were
made over, are historically most valuable. One was
worn by, and bears the name of, Jehangire, and the other
is stamped with the seal of Nadir Shah! They are singular
and interesting trophies, or rather relics, of the
house of Timour the Tartar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delhi</span>, <i>Oct. 2d</i>.&mdash;I have remained behind the force
for a day, in order to settle the business and pay up and
discharge my Intelligence Establishment. I am so busy
that my letter will of necessity be a short one. My having
been out in camp has prevented my getting at the
people and officers, who are all in the city and palace.
We, that is, the cavalry, artillery, and some infantry, are
outside on the glacis of the city, and much pleasanter it
is, I think; especially as I have good shelter under the
roof of an old mosque in a serai, where we can all put up
together without jostling. I feel quite a free man now.
I have no work to do but my regiment; though, truth to
tell, <i>that</i> is quite enough for one man, even with so able
and willing an assistant as Macdowell. I do not reckon
on much fighting where we are going, and the weather is
now getting very tolerable. The country we are going
into is also much healthier than Delhi, and I expect
much benefit from the change of air and quiet marching.
After our return I shall get away, if but for a week;
and then my anxiety is to join Napier, wherever he
may be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delhi District</span>, <i>Oct. 3d</i>.&mdash;I was yesterday four coss
from Bullnagurh, and the Rajah actually came out in his
carriage; yet I had strict orders not to interfere with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
him, so the force marched off in another direction this
morning without striking a blow, though the place was
full of the Rajah's armed retainers and fugitive Pandies
from Delhi, and they ought all to have been exterminated.
The consequence is, he will give us trouble hereafter.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
To-day we struck off to the right to this place
(marching at Brigadier Showers's favorite pace of six
miles in five hours), and go on to-morrow through Goorgaon
to a place called Rewarree, where one Toli Ram, a
farmer of Government revenue in better times, but who
now "affectionates" independent authority, has collected
a force round his fortlet of some 4,000 to 5,000 men, and
shows fight; but again I opine we shall have a tedious
march for our pains. I grieve daily in all bitterness for
poor Nicholson's death. He was a man such as one
rarely sees; next to dear Sir Henry, our greatest loss.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camp, Goorgaon</span>, <i>Oct. 4th</i>.&mdash;Even the camp before
Delhi (so long our abode that I write it mechanically)
was more favorable for letter-writing than our present
more peaceful but more moving life. We started at
three <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> and arrived here about nine. I had then to
go through the village or town with the Brigadier, and
it was noon before we got a tent pitched and breakfast
ready; before I had finished I was summoned by Showers
to give him some information as to some "Moofsids;"
and now at two <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>, though I am still unwashed and unshorn,
I am ordered to be ready at three with a party to
proceed to punish some refractory villages a few miles off.
I shall be back, I trust, at dark, to dinner and bed, for
we march again at midnight. Tell &mdash;&mdash; the swords I
have kept are beautiful, and historically most valuable.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
It was like parting with my teeth to give up those to the
General; I should not have cared so much if he had
done anything towards the winning them. It will be
something hereafter to wear a sword taken from the last
of the House of Timour, which had been girt round the
waists of the greatest of his predecessors; if I ever part
with it, it shall be "in a present," as mine O. would say,
to our good Queen! She ought to give me her own
Cross for it; and that's a fact, though I say it!</p>

<p><i>Oct. 5th</i>, 3 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>&mdash;We got back last night at dark, from
our visit of retribution to Dholkote, having "polished off"
a goodly number of rebels from Irregular Cavalry Regiments,
and others who came out armed to the teeth, and
making great demonstration of attack, but turned of
course when we charged. Had we not absurdly been
sent out in the afternoon, instead of morning, so that it
got too dark for work, we should have cleared the place
entirely. I had a most kind letter of congratulation from
&mdash;&mdash; yesterday. He seems very ill, poor fellow! How
thankful I am that my health stands work so well; not
that I do not feel it; and it will <i>tell</i> more still some day.
I question whether there is a single one of us, however
strong or unwounded, whose constitution does not pay for
the Siege of Delhi. The weather is getting very pleasant,
except in the middle of the day; but what a contrast
to the climate of the Punjaub! Many thanks to Lord
William for his offer of horses. I only wish I had the
power of using them, but there is no chance, I fear, of my
getting to Simla, though I may to Umb&acirc;la. I hear General
Wilson has gone to Meer&ucirc;t, and General Penny
come to Delhi in his stead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pathondhee</span>, <i>Oct. 5th, noon</i>.&mdash;I add a few lines to
my letter of this morning to say that all is safe and well.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
Nothing has occurred but a skirmish with our advanced
guard and some Sowars of Toli Ram's, who came, I
honestly believe, in all good faith, to bring an offer of
submission; but the business was bothered by mutual
distrust, so they turned, fired at our advance, and bolted
at speed, my men after them as hard as they could go.
They brought back about a dozen horses whose riders
they had disposed of; very acceptable they are too, for
"mounting" my men is my greatest difficulty. We have
made a good bag of the Irregular Cavalry rascals during
the last few days,&mdash;among them a native officer of the
9th Irregular Cavalry, who deserted at Delhi, (selling
Chamberlain a pretty considerable bargain too,) was
caught and shot. Seaton will rejoice at this. General
Penny reigns at Delhi.</p>

<p>There is no chance of my regiment being stationary
this cold weather, I imagine, for the country is still in
a very unsettled state, and will be so for a long time to
come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camp, Rewarree</span>, <i>Oct. 6th</i>.&mdash;We arrived here, after
a tediously protracted march, at eleven this morning, only
to find my prediction verified, that the birds would be
flown and the nest empty. Mr. Toli Ram bolted yesterday,
and left only an empty fort and his guns behind him;
in good hands it would have given us considerable trouble,
and he was evidently a clever fellow, and had adroitly
and promptly contrived so as to be first in the field, should
our power have ceased. We found extensive preparations,
and large workshops for the completion of military
equipments of all kinds, guns, gun-carriages, gunpowder,
accoutrements, and material of all kinds. He had already
done much, and in a couple of months his position
would have been so strong as to have given him the command
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
of all the surrounding country, as well as the rich
town and entrep&ocirc;t of Rewarree, close to the walls of his
fort. Had our empire fallen, he would have mastered all
the surrounding villages and districts, and probably extended
his power on all sides, and founded a "Raj" like
that of Puttiala or Jheend, to fall in its turn before the
(then) newly aroused energies of the Sikhs. At the same
time he was prepared, if we won the day, to profess that
he had done all this solely in our interests, and to preserve
the district <i>for us</i> from the Goojur population. This is
now his line of defence. Showers yesterday sent to tell
him that if he would come in and give himself up, as
well as his guns and arms, he should be treated on his
merits. This he would not do, and has eventually sealed
his fate by bolting. The extent of his warlike preparations
is too obviously the result of his really hostile, than
of his professedly friendly, intentions. I do not know
where we go next; back to Delhi, I trust, when I hope
to find General Penny willing to forward my wishes by
sending me on to join the army. It will spoil my new
regiment to keep it on mere police duty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camp, Rewarree</span>, <i>Oct. 7th</i>.&mdash;We have been all day
in the saddle, wandering about distant villages, but we
did not see an enemy, and the inhabitants seemed very
glad to see us, for the runaway rebels had plundered
every place they passed through. The whole body of
horsemen who were here up to two days before, fled in
all directions when they heard of our approach, (though
their numbers were immense, they say 7,000 to 8,000,)
and now, ride where we will, in any direction for fifteen
miles round Rewarree, not an armed man is to be seen.</p>

<p>Only this morning we heard of the capture of Lucknow,
dimmed by the death of General Neill. Are all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
our victories to be purchased at the costly price of her
best and bravest? Even I, loving my profession as I do,
a "soldier to the backbone," as Sir C. Napier used to say,
sicken at the remembrance of the good and brave and
noble who have fallen. Poor Neill! he is a loss indeed.
I trust our dear friend has escaped. I looked tremblingly
through the list, and rejoiced to find the name of Napier
not there. And now for matters of the lower (surely the
lowest) world. I have drawn no pay either for the A.
Q. M. Generalship or my regiment, except an advance of
500<i>l.</i> for current expenditure. I have as yet been able
to get no pay abstracts passed; and, indeed, such is the
confusion of all things, from the want of some central
authority, that no one knows where, or by whom, we are
to be paid; so I have to draw money for my men "on
account," to be settled hereafter; as yet, however, I take
care that it shall not exceed a third, or at utmost half
their pay, to be safely within the mark. Men and horses
cannot live on "nothing a day and find themselves," and
any regular office-work is utterly impossible while we are
kept so perpetually in the saddle. It is rather hard on a
new regiment, "raised on service,"&mdash;and a little hard on
their commandant too,&mdash;but all will come straight in the
end, I doubt not. I thought I mentioned that when we
went to the Kootub the first time with Colonel Showers,
I secured the rest of the King's sons and grandsons at
Humayoon's Tomb; but the whole were most discreditably
allowed to escape by the young civilian sent out with
the force; or, as he says, by the Brigadier; but it was
his business, and not the Brigadier's. I also found out a
lot of silver and money, worth, I should think, 20,000 or
30,000 rupees, and 20 or 30 elephants; all which goes
to swell the prize money. We ought to have a good proportionate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
sum each, for there has been an immense deal
of property taken altogether, I should think; but the
want of care and management will lessen it considerably.
As a specimen,&mdash;when Seaton was prize agent, (and
they could not have found a better or more upright,) a
quantity of property of all descriptions was brought in
and put on the "chiboutra" in front of the house he was
in. He immediately sent to ask the General either to
appoint a place to stow it in, or for a guard to put over
it. The answer was in General Wilson's usually <i>brusque</i>
style. "He had no guard to spare, and Colonel Seaton
must secure the property as he could." Colonel Seaton's
reply was to resign the prize agency. He could not well
do otherwise after this and other specimens.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 8th.</i>&mdash;I go on an expedition early to-morrow
morning to some villages, and shall be too late back
for writing.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 11th.</i>&mdash;Only three words to say that I am safe
and well. I cannot ascertain whether we go back direct
to Delhi, or by Jhujjur, to annex the Naw&acirc;b's country.
Everything is perfectly quiet here, and the weather is
really cold in the mornings: we shall all improve by
the change, though fever is very prevalent amongst the
natives. The Europeans are gaining strength daily.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camp, J&acirc;too Sana</span>, <i>Oct. 13th</i>.&mdash;We shall be at
Jhujjur, I believe, in a couple of days; where part of
General Cortland's force and the Jummoo troops will
meet us, and they will, I fancy, be left in occupation,
and we return to Delhi, where I hear a force under
General Penny is to be formed to go towards Rohilcund.
It is more than probable that we shall accompany him.
If I am allowed to go to a station to <i>form</i> my regiment,
I shall certainly try for Umb&acirc;la. The bazaars at Meerut,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
Cawnpore, &amp;c., are all destroyed, and I could get
nothing I wanted. Here I am interrupted by an order
to start on a "<i>dour</i>," which will keep us out till midnight,
if not longer.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 14th.</i>&mdash;My expectations of yesterday were fulfilled,
and we did not return till midnight to dinner,
having been in the saddle, without a halt, since 3 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>
Some rascals had chosen to go and make free with the
grain, &amp;c., left behind in Toli Ram's fort at Rampoora,
outside Rewarree, as soon as our last detachment had
come away; so I was sent back to disturb their operations.
Unfortunately Colonel Showers was too long in
making up his mind to send us, and though we marched
at the rate of more than seven miles in an hour, it was
dark before we came up with the tail of the party, just
as they were decamping with their booty; so we only
accounted for about thirty or forty. I was very weary,
so stayed behind for a few hours' rest, the column having
marched at 2 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> to Nahur, on the road to Dadree,
where we are to be joined by a portion of General Cortland's
force, and the Dick Lawrence Invincibles from
Rohtuck. We then move on Jhujjur, but not the smallest
prospect of opposition,&mdash;all the masses of Raughur
and other horsemen melting away at our approach. I
have written to Chamberlain, as Adjutant-General, to get
me a couple of months to collect, complete, and clothe
the regiment. At all events, if we cannot be spared,
I have begged that the whole regiment may be kept
together, and not scattered piecemeal over the country,
as it is now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camp, Dadree</span>, <i>Oct. 16th</i>.&mdash;The Jhujjur Nawab
has, or will give himself up; so not a shot will be fired,
for all the swarms of Irregular Cavalry have dispersed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
to their homes, or rather to the hills and jungles, for
shelter and security. Colonel Greathed's column has
reached Agra, and there had a fight; a regular surprise,&mdash;our
people being attacked while at breakfast! However,
the enemy were thoroughly thrashed eventually,
and lost camp and guns. Poor French, of the Lancers,
is the only officer whose name I have heard as killed.
A report has reached me from Simla that you have
got some magnificent diamond rings, &amp;c., taken at Delhi.
This is rather good, considering the only rings I sent you
were the princes', and not worth twenty rupees altogether,
and the only "diamonds" were in that little broach I
bought from a sowar more than a month before Delhi
was taken,&mdash;so much for the veracity of your good-natured
<i>friends</i> at Simla! It is too rich. I like Macdowell
increasingly,&mdash;he is so thoroughly honest and
gentlemanly, and brave as a lion. In Wise, too, I am
fortunate; and Wells is a fat, good-tempered, willing-to-work
school-boy. We do very well indeed together, and
I have profited by past experience, (and perhaps the
natural result of increased age and knowledge of the
world,) but things are very different <i>now</i> and <i>then</i>.</p>

<p>We were waked up at midnight, and got to our camping
ground at 11 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>, and there found neither tents nor
breakfast. We march on to Jhujjur early to-morrow.
The Nawab has made his submission, and we have
nothing to do but receive it and move on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camp, Kunound</span>, <i>Oct. 19th</i>.&mdash;We left Dadree at
1 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> yesterday, and marched ten miles to Jhujjur,
found the force dispersed and fled, and took possession
of the (very nice) fort, with heaps of guns and ammunition.
My men were out after the fugitives till half-past
ten. At noon we marched again (the 6th Dragoon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
Guards and my regiment), under Colonel Custance, to
Nahur, twenty-four miles, which we reached at sunset.
At 3 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> this morning we came on here, seventeen
miles, and took one of the strongest forts I have seen,
with fourteen guns, some very heavy ones, and five lacs
of rupees, which, alas! is to be considered Government,
not prize property. I was only out of my saddle for one
hour yesterday, from one in the morning till sunset, and
then only to get some cold food under a tree! But I
am quite well and strong, much better than I was at
Delhi; and as Colonel Custance and his officers are
remarkably agreeable gentlemanlike people, we have
had the most really pleasant days since leaving Delhi.
The worst of this raid is that it takes me from all chance
of getting away for a few days until our return.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kunound</span>, <i>Oct. 20th</i>.&mdash;I have just had a very nice
and welcome letter from &mdash;&mdash;, dated Calcutta, 5th September.
He had had a long talk about me with Mr.
Talbot, who told him that General Anson's representations
had done much good, and that it was admitted on
all hands that my exculpation <i>in re</i> the Guides was complete,
and that no higher or more flattering testimonials
were ever seen; so that, please God, I shall be righted at
last; and <i>justice</i> is all I want. I leave those who injured
me to the punishment of their own conscience, and
have no desire that their sins should be visited upon them
more than that. God saw that I was too proud and
happy at having gained the highest object of my worldly
ambition, and so chastened me, that now mere earthly
honors or success are becoming gradually of less importance
to me. To go home with an untarnished name,
and to get the repose both of body and mind which
<i>home</i> alone can give, is now the climax of my desires.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span></p>

<p>This is a very healthy country, but sandy, and, no
doubt, at times fearfully hot; even to-day there is a hot
wind blowing, and yet by midnight it will be freezing!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camp, Kunound</span>, <i>Oct. 21st</i>.&mdash;Another long day without
a d&acirc;k. I have "betwitted" Captain Trench, who
has charge of the Post-office, for taking more care of
himself than he does of us; but of course he denies the
soft impeachment <i>in toto</i>. I begin to despair of getting
back to Delhi, as we do not march hence till the 23d, and
even then it is uncertain in what direction we go. <i>Au
reste</i>, I am not sorry as it is, for my men and horses were
beginning to suffer. I had this morning thirty-eight men
and forty-three horses sick! If Captain Fenwick is still
at Simla, will you ask him if he can get me one of the
new pattern saddles he introduced into the 9th Irregular
Cavalry? I will gladly pay the cost and carriage, and
thank him into the bargain. Saddles are my greatest
difficulty in getting my regiment into order. I am doing
tolerably in the way of horses, and gradually remounting
the men, who came down badly horsed, with captured
cattle. The swords also are better than they were, from
the same source. My ankle gives me so much pain that
I have been forced to take to a small pony to ride even
about camp, so as to avoid walking even for fifty yards.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 22d.</i>&mdash;We march to-night towards Rewarree,
and shall get there on the 24th; from thence a part goes
to Goorgaon, and waits the arrival of the larger portion
of the troops which are to go into the Mewattee country,
and punish some rascals who have plundered the large
town of Sonah. The Brigadier is planning a series of
man&oelig;uvres, by which he intends to surround and capture
4,000 Mewattees. I shall be very much surprised if we
see one of that interesting race!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span></p>

<p>I fear that if my men form part of the man&oelig;uvring
party, we shall not get to Goorgaon for six or seven days,
or perhaps ten, but I hope for the direct route. In either
case, as we shall do nothing, I would rather do it with as
little fatigue to man and horse as possible. The detached
state of this regiment is enough to ruin it. Three troops
are at Agra, or thereabouts, under Hugh Gough; the
sick and depot at Delhi, and portions of five troops here;
but it seriously increases the difficulty of managing a
totally new regiment, and it is hardly fair either to the
men or to the commanding officer. I have remonstrated,
but, I suppose, with very little effect, as I have had no
answer. I trust, indeed, I may get all together and go
towards Oudh.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 23d.</i>&mdash;To-day we still halt, and I hear a rumor
that on our return we go on to Agra. My other troops
are on their way to Cawnpore, so that, I think, there is
every chance of my getting that way too. However
personally I might wish to be quiet at Umb&acirc;la for a
time, I cannot ask not to be sent on one of two expeditions
with the same end, and unquestionably for <i>our</i> best
interests. Oudh, where Napier is in power, is the best
field open. Tell &mdash;&mdash; he may unhesitatingly contradict
the story about the rupees. It was born in Delhi, and
was partly the cause of General Wilson's bad behavior
to me; the money, 60,000<i>l.</i>, was brought to me late one
night by the men, who had been desired (as Colonel
Seaton will corroborate) to secure prize property for him
and the other agents. We marched at daybreak next
morning, and I had only time to make it over to Macdowell
to see it locked up in the regimental chest for
safety before we started. When I returned, three or
four days afterwards, a story had been circulated by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
native who had disgorged the coin, that I had kept the
money for myself! Of course the very day I returned it
was, with heaps of other things, made over to the agents.
And so stories go in this world. The amount of petty
jealousy excited by what my friends call my "successes"
is beyond belief. The capture of the King and his sons,
however ultimately creditable, has caused me more envy
and ill-will than you would believe possible, but I have
had too much experience of humanity, during the last
few years, to care for envy now; and, conscious as I am
of my own rectitude of purpose at least, however I may
err in judgment, I go on my way rejoicing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camp, Patondhee</span>, <i>Oct. 27th</i>.&mdash;I am indeed most
humbly and earnestly grateful to the good God who has
so mercifully spared<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> what was so infinitely more precious
to me than life itself; and I do feel how entirely
our hearts should be filled with gratitude to Him for the
bountiful mercies which we mutually and individually
have experienced at His hands during the past year:
the preservation of us both from <i>such</i> perils; my r&euml;employment
in an honorable position; my ability to do such
good service to the country at such a crisis; the preservation
of health in such a time of exposure; my beloved
wife's power and will to tend the wounded, and succor
the distressed; my complete, though tardy, vindication
from unjust charges; my almost assured freedom from
debt;&mdash;all these mercies are almost more than my full
heart can bear, and I sink on my knees in humble gratitude
at the foot of His throne who has done such wonderful
things for us. May He crown all other blessings by
granting us a safe reunion.

<p>It will be seen by the foregoing letters that
Hodson's Horse had, by this time, acquired such
proportions that they admitted of being divided.
One detachment, under Lieut. Gough, had been
sent with Colonel Greathed's column towards
Agra, and afterwards joined Sir Colin Campbell's
force, and took part, with much distinction,
in the final relief of Lucknow by Sir Colin
and Sir James Outram.</p>

<p>The main body, with their commandant, accompanied
Brigadier Showers, and were of great
service in anticipating the movements and cutting
off the retreat of the flying enemy, as well
as in scouring the country and bringing in supplies.
Their rapidity of movement and dashing
courage made them a terror to the rebel forces,
who had, on more than one occasion, painful
experience of the keenness of their sabres.</p>

<p>In the course of the expedition, the forces of
several rebel rajahs were defeated, their strongholds
captured, with many guns, and treasure
amounting to 70,000<i>l.</i> taken, besides large quantities
of cattle.</p>

<p>On one occasion upwards of 1,700 head of
cattle had been taken. When they were brought
in, Brigadier Showers exclaimed, "Hang me!
what in the world am I to do with them? It
would take half my force to convoy them back
to Delhi. I can't take them." On this Captain
Hodson said, "Well, sir, will you sell them to
me, and let me take my chance?" "Willingly,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
said the Brigadier; so the bargain was struck for
two rupees a head. Captain Hodson sent them
off, under charge of their drivers and two or
three of his own sowars, to Delhi, where they
arrived safely, and were of course sold at a large
profit.</p>

<p>The speculation turned out a good one, but
the chances were against it. No one else, probably,
under the circumstances, would have run
the risk, and the cattle would have been left
behind.</p>

<p>I mention this anecdote as showing that in
small things as well as great my brother refused
to acknowledge difficulties, and deserved the
character given him of being the most "wide-awake"
man in the army. Shortly afterwards
he invested part of the proceeds in a house at
Umb&acirc;la, which happened to be then put up for
a forced sale at a great depreciation. This consequently
went among his friends by the name
of the "cow-house."</p>

<p>A short time before the return of the column
to Delhi, he applied for a few weeks' leave, in
order to join his wife, who had come down from
Simla to Umb&acirc;la.</p>

<p>On November 3d he wrote to his sister from
Umb&acirc;la:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
After nearly six months of separation, I was happy
enough to get back here yesterday night, and find my
wife well, and all but recovered from the effects of her
frightful accident, the most wonderful escape, perhaps,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
from imminent peril ever recorded. I take the first
holiday I have had since the 15th May, to write a few
lines to you, my dearest sister, to say what deep and
real pleasure and comfort your letters bring to me,
amidst danger and toil and fatigue; and how cheering
it is to feel that, come what may, I am sure of your
loving sympathy and constant affection. I received
yesterday your letter of the 4th May, and could not but
be most forcibly struck with the contrast between my
circumstances individually, and those of the country,
then and now. No one will rejoice more than yourself
at the sudden change, and at the tolerable success
which has been permitted to my labors....</p>

<p><i>Nov. 15th.</i>&mdash;Here my pen was arrested by the news
that the mail was gone. In these days all regularity
is set at defiance, and again we have been startled by
a notice to send our letters within half an hour, and
that, too, in the midst of preparation for a hurried return
to Delhi and Meerut, to rejoin my regiment. We
march at once to join Sir Colin Campbell and the
army assembling at Cawnpore for the reconquest of
Lucknow.</p>

<p>I am getting on famously with my regiment; men
of good family and fighting repute are really flocking to
my standard,<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> and before the end of the year I hope
to have 1,000 horsemen under my command.
</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>
I had a letter the other day from &mdash;&mdash;, at Calcutta,
from which I learn that at last the truth is beginning
to dawn on the minds of men in power regarding me.
They now say that my remonstrance will be placed on
record for preservation, "not for justification, which it is
fully admitted was not required," and that "no higher
testimonials were ever produced."</p>

<p>How much I have to be thankful for, not only for
restored position and means for future distinction, but
for safety and preservation during this terrible war, and
for my dear wife's escape.</p>

<p>You must not misunderstand my silence. I was compelled
to leave the task of writing letters to Susie; I had
barely time to keep her assured of my safety from day
to day.
</p>
</div>

<p>On the 2d December, "Hodson's Horse" were
ordered to join a movable column under Colonel
Thomas Seaton, C. B., proceeding down the
country towards Cawnpore, in charge of an immense
convoy of supplies of all kinds for the
Commander-in-Chief's army. The convoy was
calculated to extend over fifteen miles of road,&mdash;hackeries
of grain, camels, elephants, horses,&mdash;and
but 1,500 men and four guns to protect them
all. At Allygurh the forces, marching respectively
from Delhi and Meerut, united on the 11th.
On the following day Colonel Seaton, leaving
the convoy under the protection of the guns of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
the fort, proceeded by forced marches to look
after some large parties of the rebel army who
were encamped in the Do&acirc;b.</p>

<p>On the 10th, my brother wrote to his wife
from</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left25">
<span class="smcap">Camp Somna</span>, <i>14 miles from Allygurh, Dec. 10th</i>.</p>

<p>After four days of forced marches we joined the column
this morning, and march on to Allygurh to-morrow.
We have been quite out of the way of letters, both going
and coming, until to-day. The "enemy," who were supposed
to have been in our front at Khasgunge, have all
disappeared, and there seems to be no immediate prospect
of our finding another. Alfred Light marched down
with me from Meerut to this place, and now goes on with
Colonel Seaton as orderly officer, I am glad to say. We
have a frightful convoy and crowd, but I hope not for
long. The head-quarter people, Colonels Keith, Young,
Becher, and Congreve, are with us. It is said that our
friend Napier is to be Adjutant-General of the army,&mdash;delightful,
if true. I have only just got my tent up, and
it is nearly dark, so I can only say that I am safe and
well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Allygurh</span>, <i>Dec. 11th</i>.&mdash;We arrived here early this
morning, and I found Major Eld commanding and Arthur
Cocks doing Commissioner. Everything perfectly quiet
in the neighborhood, and no large gathering of Pandies
anywhere near. There is a small party at Khasgunge,
and I hope we may be lucky enough to find them, but I
doubt their waiting for us. Meantime we are to march
down the Trunk Road, halting here to-morrow. I cannot
get over our parting, each separation seems a greater
wrench than the last.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span></p>

<p>Of public news there is none, but one broad fact, that
since the 12th ultimo no news have been received from
Lucknow, and not a word even from Cawnpore since the
25th. This necessarily excites alarm, but still my impression
is, that though our people may be surrounded
with a close cordon of disaffected and rebellious men,
who cut off all communication, yet that any serious harm
can happen to a force of 8,000 or 9,000 Europeans I will
not readily believe. I have 596 sabres with me now, 50
more coming from Delhi, besides the 140 with Gough,&mdash;not
so bad that.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 12th.</i>&mdash;We hear to-day from Agra that the ladies
and sick and wounded from Lucknow and Cawnpore
have been sent down to Allahabad, and the Gwalior Contingent
beaten. The Commander-in-Chief is at Cawnpore,
and troops will be assembling there enough to put
down all opposition, and open the road to Calcutta. We
march to-morrow morning from hence, leaving the "<i>impedimenta</i>"
behind here until we can ascertain that the
road is clear; when it is so, all will move on. We have
fifteen guns, mostly 9-pounders, with our small but compact
force. Major Eld joins us with a part of his garrison,
and Colonel Farquhar brings 300 Belooches, 200
Affghans, and two guns to our aid. We shall be 2,500
fighting men, and the "fathers of rebels" will hardly
stomach so much as that! Colonel Seaton is doing admirably,
very firm and very wide awake; so all will, I
doubt not, go well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jul&acirc;lee</span>, <i>Dec. 13th</i>.&mdash;Your letter, inclosing our darling
sister's, found us lying in the dust, with a pea-soup
atmosphere of fine sand all around, discussing hot tea and
eggs, just as I had returned from a <i>reconnoissance</i> to the
front, in virtue of my being the big eye and ear of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
camp.... The paragraph in the <i>Lahore Chronicle</i> was
too absurd, and beneath my notice; but to please you
and Macdowell I consented to his saying anything he
pleased on the subject. Naturally, I must err sometimes
in judgment, even with prayer for my aid; but I never
swerve from my one and only aim, to do my duty as well
and strictly as I can; so the praise or blame of men
affect me less than if I took public opinion and not conscience
for my guide. But <i>apropos</i> of the newspapers,
Arthur Cocks tells me that the <i>Friend of India</i> has apologized
for its strictures on my conduct <i>in re</i> the Shahzadahs;
so let that satisfy you, for nothing I could write, or
my friends for me, could ever be half so effectual as the
<i>Friend's</i> voluntary <i>amende</i>.... I intended to have
written much to-day, but I was waked at 3 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>, marched
soon after, and with the exception of the dusty breakfast
(cheered by my letters), I was in the saddle till half-past
2 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> Then regimental business, washed and dressed,
then threw myself on my bed for half an hour till dinner,
after which we get to bed as soon as we can, and up
again at 3 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>, so there is not much time for what I
want to do of private matters. There's a history of a
day in camp.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camp, Gungeree</span>, <i>Dec. 14th</i>.&mdash;I have only time to
say that I am safe and well, though we have had a hard
fight. The enemy's cavalry, with three guns and some
infantry, came on from Bilaram to meet us this morning
after breakfast,&mdash;about 800 horsemen and a mob of
foot,&mdash;but our guns soon stopped their progress, and
then the Carabineers and Lancers charged straight down
on them in the most magnificent style, capturing all three
of their guns at a dash! I grieve to say, however, that
they paid most dearly for their splendid courage. All
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
their officers went down. Captain Wardlaw, Mr. Hudson,
and Mr. Vyse, all killed, and Head, of the Lancers,
badly wounded. The infantry were not engaged at all.
<i>We</i> attacked their flying cavalry and footmen on the left,
and made very short work of all we could catch. I lost
a fine old Resaldar, our dear old friend Mohammed Reza
Khan's brother. None of my officers hurt; but my
horse (Rufus this time) got a cut.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camp near Puttialee</span>, <i>17th</i>.&mdash;I have but time for
one line again to say that "all's well." We have been
on our horses for eleven hours! The enemy had the
boldness to await our arrival here in great force and
partly intrenched. We attacked them soon after 8 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>,
they firing aimlessly at us as we advanced, our guns coming
into play with fine effect. I then dashed into their
camp with my regiment, Bishop's troop of Artillery
actually charging with us like cavalry fairly into their
camp! We drove them through camp and town, and
through gardens, fields, and lanes, capturing every gun
and all their ammunition and baggage. We pushed on
for six or seven miles, and read them a terrible lesson.
The Carabineers and my men alone must have killed some
500 or 600 at least, all sowars and fanatics. We wound
up by killing the Naw&acirc;b, who led them on his elephant,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
after a long chase and an ingenious struggle, in which he
was fairly pulled out of his houdah. I am very tired,
but delighted with our day's work on Seaton's account.
We have captured thirteen guns and entirely dispersed
the enemy. He ought to be made a K. C. B. for this.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Puttialee</span>, <i>19th</i>.&mdash;I have just returned from a twenty-five
miles' ride reconnoitring towards the gh&acirc;ts of the
Ganges, and breakfasted <i>al fresco</i> at 1&frac14; <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>; so I am
not too fresh, as you may imagine, after the last few days
of hard work and hard galloping. Colonel Seaton tells
me that he wrote to you after our very successful action
here. He does all his work so well and pleasantly that
it is a pleasure to work under him. We have a very
compact force and capital officers, so everything goes on
smoothly and comfortably. The remnant of the gentry
we thrashed here seem never to have stopped running
since. Another party have, however, crossed over from
Rohilcund, and are said to be coming our way. I only
wish they may.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 20th.</i>&mdash;We march back to-morrow, and shall be
at Etah on the Grand Trunk Road on the 24th, when the
convoy will come on to rejoin us. I have ascertained
that the result of our affair here has been to drive the
whole of the rebels out of the country between this and
Futtehgurh.</p>

<p>From Etah we shall disperse the Mynpooree party,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
and then I think there will be no rebels left in the Do&acirc;b
save at Futtehgurh, and those the Commander-in-Chief
will dispose of.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Khasgunge</span>, <i>23d</i>.&mdash;The more we move in this direction,
the more do we realize of the satisfactory results of
our expedition and our fight of the 17th. It really was
a very complete affair, and had it been done under the
eyes of the Commander-in-Chief, I should have been
made a colonel. However, I can but admit that every
disposition exists here to give me (perhaps more than)
my due. To-day we have for the first time heard of the
Commander-in-Chief's movements. He comes up in two
columns, <i>vi&acirc;</i> the Grand Trunk Road, and <i>vi&acirc;</i> the Jumna
towards Mynpooree. We shall be at the latter place on
Christmas day, I hope, and clear out the remainder of the
rebels who may still be lurking about the roads and villages.
We caught yesterday one of the rebel leaders, an
old Resaldar, covered with honors, pension, and dignity
by our Government! These rascals are as impervious to
gratitude as they are ignorant of truth. The neighborhood
of Futtehgurh has brought vividly home to me the
horrors committed, and the dreadful fate of poor Tudor
Tucker, his wife, children, and the other victims, is ever
before me; it often recalls a sterner judgment when we
feel inclined to <i>spare</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Etah</span>, <i>Dec. 24th</i>.&mdash;We got here after an eighteen
miles' march, and hear that the Chief was to leave Cawnpore
"in a few days" from the 14th, and would move up
the Grand Trunk Road with one column, sending another
to skirt the Jumna. General Windham is said to be
coming up to take the divisional command at Umb&acirc;la.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mullown, Christmas Day.</span>&mdash;There seems a fatality
against our spending these anniversaries together; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
my heart is full of deep and earnest prayer for you and
all my loved ones, and I try to hope that our next Christmas
may be spent <i>at home</i>.</p>

<p>We march to Kerowlee to-morrow, and shall be at
Mynpooree on the 27th, there to halt for a few days,
until the convoy is collected and we can hear from the
Commander-in-Chief. We have just heard that Mayhew
is the new Adjutant-General, and Norman, Deputy. This
last is a splendid thing, and shows Sir Colin's determination
to put the right man in the right place, in spite of all
the red tape and seniority systems in the world! I can
hear nothing of our dear friend Napier, but I suppose he
is with Sir James Outram.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mynpooree</span>, <i>December 27th</i>.&mdash;We have just returned
from a sixteen miles' pursuit of the rebel force posted in
front of this place. They only waited until the Horse
Artillery guns opened on them, and then fled precipitately,
so we had to ride hard to overtake them. They
flung away their arms, and became simple villagers with
astonishing rapidity; it would have done credit to the
stage. No one hurt but two of my sowars. We have
got all their guns (six in number), and the Do&acirc;b is clear
now to Futtehgurh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mynpooree</span>, <i>December 28th</i>.&mdash;The Commander-in-Chief
had not left Cawnpore on the 16th, but was to do
so very soon; we hope to hear of him. Please send the
inclosed notes to the ladies to whom they are addressed,
and if they like to inclose me any <i>miniature</i> replies, I
will take care they are safely forwarded to their husbands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mynpooree</span>, <i>December 29th</i>.&mdash;I <i>have</i> spoken about
poor Wardlaw's effects, and Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;'s kind offer was
accepted gladly; but a reference to Meerut was necessary,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
and I have not yet had a final answer. Poor fellow!
never was a more gallant charge than the last he
led, and I agree with his brother officers that "a kinder
friend, a more gallant soldier, and a better comrade,
never stepped than George Wardlaw." Both his death
and that of his comrade, Mr. Hudson, were perhaps unnecessary,&mdash;by
which I mean that a better acquaintance
with their enemy might have saved both. The former,
after the charge, dashed single-handed&mdash;with a cheer&mdash;into
a knot of matchlock-men waiting to receive him, and
was shot dead instantly. Had he gathered together only
half a dozen dragoons, he might have ridden over them.
The other (Hudson) was shot by a wretched fugitive
lying prostrate in a field. Not understanding their tactics,
he rode up to him and halted, thus offering a fair
mark for the villain's ready musket. He was a son of
the ex-Railway King.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mynpooree</span>, <i>December 30th</i>, 6 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>&mdash;I am just
starting for the Chief's camp, which is at or near
Goorsahaigunge, some forty miles from hence. I am
taking despatches from Colonel Seaton, and to see that
the road is clear. I hope to be back to dinner. Mac
goes with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bewar, Grand Trunk Road</span>, <i>December 31st</i>.&mdash;Yesterday,
I rode with Mac to the Commander-in-Chief's
camp. It was farther off than I had been led to believe,
and I had to go fifty-four miles to reach him. I found
him wonderfully fresh and well, and met with a most
cordial and hearty welcome from him, General Mansfield,
and, in fact, from all. Gough, Bruce, and Mackinnon, all
fat and well. I was much pleased with all I heard and
saw; the sight of the sailors and the Highlanders did my
eyes and heart good. Such dear, wild-looking fellows as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
these Jack-tars are, but so respectful and proper in conduct
and manner. Our dear Napier is wounded, I grieve
to say, though, thank God! not badly, and is left behind
at Cawnpore. So I am gazetted a <i>Captain</i> at last! All
the letters, papers, and despatches relative to Delhi have
been published, and I am again thanked in despatches by
the Governor-General.... Sir Colin was very complimentary,
and my men, under Gough, have won great
distinction and universal praise. I rejoiced to see my
old friend Norman in his proper place, the <i>de facto</i> Adjutant-General
of the army; and Hope Grant has done
everything admirably. We Punjaubee cavalry folks are
quite "the thing" just now.... We had a narrow
escape yesterday from a party of the enemy crossing the
road <i>en route</i> from the southward to Futtehgurh; they
attacked my sowars after we (Mac and I) had ridden on,
and killed one of them, and wounded several. Coming
back at night, we passed quite close to the enemy's
bivouac, hearing their voices distinctly; but by taking it
quietly, and riding on soft ground, we got past unmolested
and into Bewar (to which place Seaton moved up this
morning) by 3 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>, having dined with the Commander-in-Chief
last evening. We had ridden ninety-four miles
since six in the morning. I, seventy-two on one horse,
my gallant Rufus. We astonished the head-quarter
people not a little.
</p>
</div>

<p>I am again indebted to the pen of Lieutenant
Macdowell, for a fuller account of the hairbreadth
escape which he and my brother had in the course
of this ride, in which they so gallantly and successfully
opened communication between the two
forces.

"<span class="smcap">Camp, Bewar</span>, <i>Jan. 1st, 1858</i>.</p>

<p>"You know we took Mynpooree on the 27th. We
halted that day and the two following. On the night of
the 29th, Hodson came into my tent, about nine o'clock,
and told me a report had come in that the Commander-in-Chief
had arrived with his forces at Goorsahaigunge,
about thirty-eight miles from Mynpooree, and that he had
volunteered to ride over to him with despatches, asking
me at the same time if I would accompany him. Of
course I consented at once, and was very much gratified
by his selecting me as his companion. At 6 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> the
next morning we started, with seventy-five sowars of
our own regiment. I do not wish to enhance the danger
of the undertaking, but shall merely tell you that since
Brigadier Grant's column moved down this road towards
Lucknow, it had been closed against all Europeans; that
we were not certain if the Commander-in-Chief's camp
was at Goorsahaigunge (which uncertainty was verified,
as you will see); and that, to say the least of it, there
was a chance of our falling in with roving bands of the
enemy.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>"We started at 6 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>, and reached Bewar all safe,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
fourteen miles from our camp. Here we halted, and ate
sandwiches, and then, leaving fifty men to stay till our
return, pushed on to Chibberamow, fourteen miles farther
on. Here we made another halt, and then, leaving the
remaining twenty-five men behind, we pushed on by ourselves,
unaccompanied, for Goorsahaigunge, where we
hoped to find the Commander-in-Chief. On arriving
there (a fourteen miles' stage), we found the Commander-in-Chief
was at Meerun-ke-Serai, fifteen miles farther
on. This was very annoying; but there was no help for
it, so we struck out for it as fast as we could, the more so
as we heard that the enemy, 700 strong, with four guns,
was within two miles of us. We arrived at Meerun-ke-Serai
at 4 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>, and found the camp there all right. We
were received most cordially by all, and not a little surprised
were they to hear where we had come from.
Hodson was most warmly received by Sir Colin Campbell,
and was closeted with him till dinner-time. Meanwhile,
I sought out some old friends, and amused myself
with looking at the novel sight of English sailors employed
with heavy guns. I also went to see the Highlanders,
and magnificent fellows they are, with their bonnets
and kilts, looking as if they could eat up all the
Pandies in India. A summons to the Commander-in-Chief's
table called me away, and off I went to dinner,
when I found Hodson seated by Sir Colin, and carrying
on a most animated conversation with him. We had a
very pleasant dinner, and at 8 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> started on our long
ride (fifty-four miles) back. We arrived at Goorsahaigunge
all safe, and pushed on at once for the next stage,
Chibberamow. When we had got half way, we were
stopped by a native, who had been waiting in expectation
of our return. God bless him! I say, and I am sure you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
will say so too when you have read all. He told us
that a party of the enemy had attacked our twenty-five
sowars at Chibberamow, cut up some, and beaten back
the rest, and that there was a great probability some of
them (the enemy) were lurking about the road to our
front. This was pleasant news, was it not?&mdash;twenty
miles from the Commander-in-Chief's camp, thirty from
our own; time, midnight; scene, an open road; <i>dramatis
person&aelig;</i>, two officers armed with swords and revolvers,
and a howling enemy supposed to be close at hand. We
deliberated what we should do, and Hodson decided we
should ride on at all risks. 'At the worst,' he said, 'we
can gallop back; but we'll try and push through.' The
native came with us, and we started. I have seen a few
adventures in my time, but must confess this was the
most trying one I had ever engaged in. It was a piercingly
cold night, with a bright moon and a wintry sky,
and a cold wind every now and then sweeping by and
chilling us to the very marrow. Taking our horses off
the hard road on to the side where it was soft, so that the
noise of their footfalls could be less distinctly heard, we
silently went on our way, anxiously listening for every
sound that fell upon our ears, and straining our sight to
see if, behind the dark trees dotted along the road, we
could discern the forms of the enemy waiting in ambush
to seize us. It was indeed an anxious time. We proceeded
till close to Chibberamow. 'They are there,'
said our guide in a whisper, pointing to a garden in a
clump of trees to our right front. Distinctly we heard
a faint hum in the distance;&mdash;whether it was the enemy,
or whether our imagination conjured up the sound, I
know not. We slowly and silently passed through the
village, in the main street of which we saw the dead body
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
of one of our men lying stark and stiff and ghastly in
the moonlight; and on emerging from the other side, dismissed
our faithful guide, with directions to come to our
camp,&mdash;and then, putting spurs to our horses, we galloped
for the dear life to Bewar, breathing more freely
as every stride bore us away from the danger now happily
past. We reached Bewar at about two o'clock <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>,
and found a party of our men sent out to look for us.
Our troopers had ridden in to say they had been attacked
and driven back, and that we had gone on alone, and all
concluded we must fall into the hands of the enemy.
We flung ourselves down on charpoys and slept till daylight,
when our column marched in, and we received the
hearty congratulations of all on our escape. What do
you think of it? The man whose information gave us
such timely warning, and thereby prevented our galloping
on, by which we should certainly have excited the attention
of the enemy, has been very handsomely rewarded,
and obtained employment.</p>

<p>"It appears from the reports afterwards received, that
the party that cut up our men were fugitives from Etawah,
where a column of ours, under General Walpole,
had arrived. They consisted of about 1,500 men, with
seven guns, and were proceeding to Futtypore. We rode
in at one end of Chibberamow in the morning;&mdash;they
rode in at the other. They saw us, but we did not see
them, as we were on unfavorable ground. Thinking we
were the advanced guard of our column, they retired
hastily to a village some two coss off. Meanwhile, Hodson
and I, unconscious of their vicinity, rode on. They sent
out scouts, and ascertained that only twenty-five of our
sowars were in the village, upon which they resumed
their march, sending a party to cut up our men, and, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
suppose, to wait for our return. All Hodson said when
we were at Bewar, and safe, was 'By George! Mac, I'd
give a good deal for a cup of tea,' and immediately went
to sleep. He is the coolest hand I have ever yet met.
We rode ninety-four miles. Hodson rode seventy-two on
one horse, the little dun, and I rode Alma seventy-two
miles also."
</p>
</div>

<p>Colonel Seaton, in a letter written shortly afterwards
to Mrs. Hodson, thus describes the anxiety
he felt:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left65">
"<span class="smcap">Mahomedabad</span>, <i>Jan. 5th</i>.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a fright I was in the night before we
marched from Mynpooree. Your husband knew that I
was most anxious to communicate with the Commander-in-Chief,
and volunteered to ride across, and as Mr. Cocks
said that he had most positive information that the Commander-in-Chief
was at Goorsahaigunge, I consented.
He started at daybreak, taking a strong party of his own
regiment.</p>

<p>"At sunset, one of his men returned, saying that he
and Macdowell had left a party at Chibberamow, and
ridden forward; that the party had subsequently been
surprised by the enemy, and cut up.</p>

<p>"At first, this seemed most alarming, yet I had the
greatest faith in his consummate prudence and skill. I
knew Macdowell was with him, and I said to myself, 'If
those two are not sharp enough to dodge the black fellows,
why the d&mdash;&mdash; is in it.' But still I could not help
feeling most uneasy, and saying, 'Oh, dear! what should
I say to his poor wife!' I did not sleep one wink all
night. In the morning a sowar galloped in with a note
from him. Oh, what a relief to my mind!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span></p>

<p>"The day before yesterday, we rode over together to
the Commander-in-Chief's camp at Goorsahaigunge, and
found he had moved on four miles beyond the Kalee
Nuddee. We followed, and came in for the tail of a
fight, as there were still some dropping shots. I was
received with great cordiality by the Commander-in-Chief,
and warmly congratulated on our successes.</p>

<p>"Your gallant husband has now left me, and I find it
most painful to part, for he is a warm friend and true
soldier; always ready with his pen, his sword, or his
counsel at my slightest wish; indeed, he often anticipated
my wishes, as if he could divine what I wanted. I
missed his cheerful manly face at my breakfast this morning,
and am not in a good-humor at all to-day."
</p>
</div>

<p>In a letter to England of the same date, my
brother says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
At last, after twelve years' service, I am a Captain
regimentally from the 14th September last; poor Major
Jacobs' death after the assault having given me my promotion,&mdash;dearly
purchased by the death of such a man!
I have much to be thankful for, not only for the most
unhoped-for escapes from wounds and death, but for the
position I now occupy, and for the appreciation my work
has received from those in power. My new regiment
has done good service, and got much <span class="greek" title="kudos">&#954;&#8166;&#948;&#959;&#962;</span>.
</p>
</div>

<p>On January 1, 1858, he writes to his wife from</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span class="smcap">Camp, Bewar.</span>&mdash;I must write a few lines on this
<i>jour de l'an</i>, though they will be but few, as we start
shortly for the Commander-in-Chief's camp at Goorsahaigunge,
twenty-eight miles off,&mdash;the "we" means
Colonel Seaton, Light, and myself. I do hope it will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
then be decided when we are to join the Chief, which, for
many reasons, I am most anxious to do. Macdowell
wrote you a capital account of our expedition to Meerun-ke-Serai,
which you will get before this reaches you. He
is <i>game</i> to the backbone, but he has not the physical
stamina for such an adventure as that. I am sorry to
say I lost three of my men killed and four wounded, and
my horse, saddle and bridle (English), were lost. I wish
you could coax &mdash;&mdash; out of that horse he got of General
Anson; life and more than life sometimes depends on
being well mounted.</p>

<p><i>January 3d.</i>&mdash;We did not get back from Goorsahaigunge
till two this morning, very weary and tired, and
now comes an order, just as I am sitting down to write,
for my regiment to march at once to join the Chief's
camp near Futtehgurh; so I am again reduced to the
mere announcement that I am safe and well. I have just
heard that the rebels have bolted from Futtehgurh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Futtehgurh</span>, <i>4th January</i>.&mdash;A night-march of
twenty-five miles, tents up at 1 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>, after which breakfast,
and two interviews with the Chief and his staff,
have not left me much daylight or time for the post.
Futtehgurh was abandoned as I foretold, and our troops
are all concentrating here, not a shot having been fired.
We remain here a few days, but a few inglorious but
needful burning expeditions will probably be all we shall
have to do. Our dear friend Napier is recovered, or
nearly so, from his wound. I hope he will join the
Chief, who appreciates him as he deserves.</p>

<p><i>January 5th.</i>&mdash;The anniversary of the most blessed
event in my life again to be spent in absence.... I see
no chance just yet of any vigorous action by which the
war might be concluded, and we released from this toilsome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
campaign. The Commander-in-Chief is tied by
red tape, and obliged to wait the orders of Government
as to where he is to go! Are our rulers <i>still</i> infatuated?
You complain of the shortness of my letters, and with
justice; but the most important business, often the safety
of the force, depends on my doing my duty unflinchingly.
Colonel Seaton dines with me to-day to drink your health
on this <i>our</i> day. I have spoken for Reginald<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> to come
and do duty with him; but I fear that "Seaton's fighting
column" has sunk in the sea of this great camp, but I
will do my best to get the dear boy down here.</p>

<p><i>6th.</i>&mdash;We march to-day, with a brigade under Colonel
Adrian Hope, on some punishing expeditions. I hope to
return in three or four days, and where we go next is
not known. Seaton has subsided for the present into
the simple Colonel of Fusiliers, which seems hard enough
after all he has done. I hope they will soon give him a
brigade.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camp, Shumshabad</span>, <i>January 7th</i>.&mdash;Here we are on
the move again! Colonel Hope's brigade, consisting of
the 42d and 73d Highlanders, 2d Punjaub Infantry, a
Royal Artillery battery, two guns Bengal H. A., a squadron
of Lancers, and half my men&mdash;a splendid little
force with nothing to do I fear but pull down houses, the
owners of which have all escaped. We are only a few
miles from the place to which we pursued the enemy
from Puttialee, and had Colonel Seaton been allowed to
push on <i>then</i>, we should have caught and punished these
rascals as they deserved. Brigadier Hope is a very fine
fellow and a pleasant; about my age, or younger if anything,
though, of course, longer in the army. When he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
knows more of India he will do very well indeed, I
should think. Wise, Macdowell, Gough the younger,
and a Mr. Cockerell, are with me. I can make out
nothing of our probable plans, or rather of the Chief's.
"Waiting for orders" seems to be the order of the day.
If something is not speedily decided, the hot weather will
be on us before our work is over, and this would tell terribly
on us all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camp, Kaimgunge</span>, <i>January 8th</i>.&mdash;We remain here
to-morrow, and then return, I fancy, to head-quarters. I
can bear up manfully against absence and separation
when we are actually doing anything; but when I see
nothing doing towards an end, I confess my heart sinks,
and my spirit hungers after rest. I should be very, very
glad if dear Maynard would make up her mind to join
you. It would be a real comfort to me to think that we
had been able to do anything towards contributing to her
peace or comfort. Independently of my sincere regard
for her, she is her father's daughter, and I owe him too
much gratitude and reverence not to desire to show it in
every way to all of the name and blood of Thomason.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kaimgunge</span>, <i>January 10th</i>.&mdash;Our time has been taken
up with riding about the country after Whippoorwills,
which elude our search and grasp, the only consolation
being fine exercise in a fine country. Will you ask
Lord W. Hay whether, if the report of his going home
be true, he will resell me the mules? I should be most
thankful to get them again, and twice the number; they
are much better for baggage than ponies, carry larger
loads, and do not knock up so soon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camp, Futtehgurh</span>, <i>January 12th</i>.&mdash;We returned
from our brief expedition this morning, not having effected
much, though we frightened many, I have no doubt. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
was just talking to Colonel Hope (himself an old 60th
man), about my dear good friend Douglas, when I got
your letter inclosing his most welcome one. How rejoiced
I shall be if he returns to India with his battalion!
I quite long to see him once more. Indeed, as time goes
on, old ties of affection and friendship seem to unite themselves
more intimately with newer and dearer ones, and
my heart pines more and more for home and all which
nought but home can give.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Futtehgurh</span>, <i>January 14th</i>.&mdash;I was unhappily so
much delayed by a tedious review yesterday morning,
and an interview with the Chief afterwards, that I did
not get to my tent till after post-time, though I am thankful
to say I found some very precious missives,&mdash;the
dear girls' letters were a treat indeed, and gave me very
real pleasure. I am beginning to hope that I shall have
my previous services recognized; for although I do not
know that any record of the promise of a majority was
down in Leadenhall Street, still Lord Dalhousie's promise
was distinct, and there is evidently every desire on
our present Chief's part to do me justice. You ask
about my position here, and do not quite understand how
the safety of the camp can depend on my vigilance.
This referred not to this camp, but to Colonel Seaton's
(now at last a Brigadier), where I not only was Assistant
Quartermaster-General, but had all the outposts to
furnish. <i>Here</i> I am desired to continue my intelligence
business; but there is another officer (Captain Bruce)
actually in charge of the department. I suppose it is
intended rather to employ me when detached from the
main force, as the other day under Brigadier Hope.
However, I am at present in charge of all in Captain
Bruce's absence, and my continuing it or not depends
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
very much on circumstances. Nothing can be kinder or
more cordial than the Commander-in-Chief and General
Mansfield. We seem destined to halt here at present;
half the day has been occupied in changing ground. So
when one can't get one's tent pitched till 1 or 2 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>,
there is little time for writing for a post closing at 5, considering
that business and eating and washing have to be
performed. I must try and write more to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camp on the Ramgunga</span>, <i>January 15th</i>.&mdash;I left off
my last letter with a promised intention of writing more
last night, but the result of dining with the Chief was,
that I was kept up so late and had to rise so early that I
was fain to carry my weary limbs to bed at once. We
have been occupied all day in getting down here from the
big camp at Futtehgurh some ten miles off, so that I am
again perforce obliged to renew instead of fulfilling my
promise. You will hear of me before this reaches you;
General Grant and Majors Norman and Turner having
taken wing to Umb&acirc;la for a few days. They have had
no holiday since May, and heartily deserved one, though
I must confess I did feel a little envious when I saw
them off. What would not I give for home once more!</p>

<p>We are here to force a passage across the Ramgunga,
a confluent of the Ganges on the road to Bareilly; but
it does not follow that we shall go there when the passage
is open. Brigadier Walpole commands, and we have
enough troops to eat up Rohilcund; whether we (<i>i.e.</i>,
my regiment) partake of the "finish" in Oude or not, no
one can pretend to foretell.</p>

<p>Colonel Becher will be at Umb&acirc;la soon, on his way
home. You will be kind to him I am sure, both because
you like him personally, and because he has been
most kind and considerate to me. It was very ungracious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
as well as ungraceful, that his name was not
mentioned in the Despatches as it ought to have been;
but he is not the only one who has cause to complain of
the "ungraciousness" of our Delhi General.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camp on the Ramgunga</span>, <i>January 17th</i>.&mdash;We are
still in the same undignified attitude of looking at nothing
and doing as little; but the halt has been very useful
to me in the way of getting through business, and I
have hardly stirred from my table all day. The plundering
propensities of some of my men have given me
much occupation and annoyance, as I always feel that
the ill-conduct of a regiment must more or less reflect
on the officers. The rascals will not discriminate between
an enemy's property, which is fair game, and that
of the villagers and cultivators of the soil. I have several
times been obliged to bring them up with a sharp
hand to save myself from discredit. I sent three sowars
to-day to the Brigadier with evidence and proof enough
to hang them, but he begged me to dispose of the matter
summarily myself; but as I did not choose to be judge,
jury, and hangman all in one, they saved their lives at
the expense of their backs, though I believe the punishment
was greater to me than to them, for I abhor flogging,
and never resort to it but in the extremest cases.
Still I must be obeyed by these wild hordes <i>coute qui
coute</i>; and when reason and argument fail, they must
learn that I will not weakly refrain from sterner measures.
I am happy to find Sir Colin ready to back me
<i>&agrave; l'outrance</i> so as to maintain discipline. Have you
written to our dear friends Napier and Prendergast yet?
The latter is in Calcutta with his bride long ago. Sir
James Outram and Napier have given Mister Pandy a
glorious thrashing at Alumbagh. Hurrah!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span></p>

<p><i>January 19th.</i>&mdash;I had to go over to see the Chief,
yesterday, and did not return till night. I also saw good
Colonel Seaton and Becher, who (the last) starts in a
day or two for home and England. I did know about
Mr. Wemyss's good appointment, for Sir Colin good-naturedly
gave me the letter to take to him. Wemyss is
a lucky fellow, and will, I hope, do credit to his luck.
I only wish I had some family interest to bring into
play; my lieutenant-colonelcy would be certain. H.
Maxwell is to be the new Adjutant of my dear old
regiment, and ought to make a good one; there is no
one now with the regiment who has any experience of
the work, and Maxwell is more likely to learn than
many; he has grown such a tall handsome fellow since
we saw him at Benares, and is said to be a fine soldier
in the field. Mac has a letter from Lord William speaking
with enthusiasm of the conduct of some of the ladies
during the Simla panics. He does not seem to be the
only one who thinks that heroism in the hills is confined
to the weaker sex. I am working to get some pay as
Assistant Quartermaster-General, in addition to my pay
as commandant, which the pay officer objects to, on the
ground that one man cannot draw the pay of two offices.
They should have had two men to do it then; for I
worked like a slave, and the laborer is worthy of his hire.
I saw and had a long talk with your "charming" Mr.
Raikes yesterday.</p>

<p><i>January 22d.</i>&mdash;There has been no news of public
importance for some days, so I am taking advantage
of the halt and comparative idleness to work off arrears
of business and papers, and to prepare rolls and pay
abstracts for Captain Swinton's office. I have consequently
not been half a mile from my tent these two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
days; moreover, I am resting my unlucky ankle, which
has given me much pain and trouble lately. I am
very glad Mr. Montgomery is at Umb&acirc;la. I am sure
you would tell him how grateful I have ever felt for his
assistance in raising my regiment; the two troops he
sent me I shall call Montgomery's troops, and the men
will like it too. I am sadly off for horses, so if you
really do not care to ride until "the sweet time of grace"
of our reunion, I shall be very thankful for Selim.
Will you ask Mr. Forsyth to ascertain for me by telegraph,
whether Mr. Eliot at Loodiana has sent off my
other troop from thence? I must try and get as many
of my men together as I can during this halt.</p>

<p><i>23d.</i>&mdash;Our friend Colonel Seaton is to have command
of a district to be formed of Allygurh, Futtehgurh,
Mynpooree, and the post at Meerun-ke-Serai. It
is a very honorable and important post; but he would
prefer, and I for him, a more active command. I expect
the rest of the force will move into Oudh soon, and
I do trust to be at the ultimate capture of Lucknow,
which ought to earn me the Queen's Cross, if "deerin
do" can gain it.</p>

<p><i>24th.</i>&mdash;They say we are to move soon, but no one
knows for certain, as I have not been into head-quarters
for some days; meantime my pen is busy, <i>very</i> busy,
with six months' arrears to work off, but I am getting
on at it famously.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Futtehgurh</span>, <i>26th</i>.&mdash;Late last night I was roused
up by an order to march in here at dawn, so here, accordingly,
we came; and now at 10 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> we are off again,
on some expedition which will last us a few days.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
The Chief sent for me as soon as we came in, and was
very communicative, and asked my opinion in most flattering
terms. I gave it honestly, and only hope he will
follow it, if we are to make an end of this business before
another hot season sets in. I fancy the whole force will
be in motion soon towards Oudh; but nothing is certainly
known as yet, except that we go to our old place
Shumshabad. Colonel Adrian Hope again commands
the brigade; we start almost immediately, and shall, I
hope, do something effective.

<p>Though I sent you a telegram, I must manage a few
words by letter to tell you that there is not the very
slightest cause for alarm on my account, for I am really
quite well; only my right arm will be useless for some
weeks, but I can do my duty, and intend to march with
the Commander-in-Chief. What grieves me most is the
loss of poor Mac; he was invaluable to me as a brilliant
soldier, a true friend, and thorough gentleman,&mdash;I mourn
as for a brother.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span></p>

<p><i>January 29th.</i>&mdash;My constant fear is that you should
be alarmed for me. I assure you there is not the slightest
occasion for anxiety. I have a cut on my hand, and
another sabre-cut over the forearm, but neither will be
of more than temporary inconvenience. I am obliged to
write with my left hand, <i>that is all</i>. I go about as usual,
and dined with the Chief last night. It was a splendid
little affair at Shumshabad, and our men and officers did
wonders, and have gained great credit. We charged a
large body of the enemy's cavalry, superior in numbers,
and all else, to ourselves. They fought us desperately,
returning twice to the charge. We then attacked their
infantry, all fanatics, who fought with the courage of despair.
Their loss must have been immense; but we have
lost one who outweighs them all. I cannot tell you how
much I feel it. We bury the dear fellow this evening
by the side of the murdered Tudor Tucker.

<p>In a letter to England of the same date, he
says:&mdash;</p>

<span class="left25 smcap">Camp, Futtehgurh</span>, <i>Jan. 31st, 1858</i>.<br />
<span class="left45">(<i>Written with left hand.</i>)</span></p>

<p>My usual fortune deserted me on the 27th, at Shumshabad,
for I got two sabre-cuts on my right arm, which
have reduced me to this very sinister style of writing

(absit omen). We had a very stiff fight of it, as we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
were far in advance of the rest of the troops, and had to
charge a very superior body of the mutineer cavalry;
but there was nothing for it but fighting, as, had we not
attacked them, they would have got in amongst our guns.
We were only three officers, and about 180 horsemen,&mdash;my
poor friend, and second in command, Macdowell, having
received a mortal wound a few minutes before we
charged. It was a terrible <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> for some time, and we
were most wonderfully preserved. However, we gave
them a very proper thrashing, and killed their leaders.
Two out of the three of us were wounded, and five of
my men killed, and eleven wounded, besides eleven
horses. My horse had three sabre-cuts, and I got two,
which I consider a rather unfair share. The Commander-in-Chief
is very well satisfied, I hear, with the day's
work, and is profusely civil and kind to me. The force
moves on to-morrow towards Cawnpore and Lucknow,
which has at last to be conquered; for neither Outram,
Havelock, nor the Commander-in-Chief were able to effect
a footing in Lucknow. All they could do was to
bring away the Residency garrison. All the lion's share
of the work, in the six weeks which intervened between the
<i>soi-disant</i> relief of the Lucknow garrison by Havelock,
and the real one by the Commander-in-Chief, was done
by our friend Colonel Napier. He is the best man we
have left, now that poor Sir Henry Lawrence and Nicholson
are gone. The next is Major Tombs, or I am much
mistaken.... I hope to return to Umb&acirc;la when this
war is over, to be refitted and get my men trained and
drilled, which is very necessary. I do hope to be able to
get home and see your dear faces once more, as soon as
our great task is accomplished. I want a change, after
twelve years of work, and I want to try what home and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
good treatment will do for my ankle, which is very bad;
in fact, I am unable to walk a hundred yards without
pain. Well, I think I have done pretty well with my
left hand. They say I shall be well in six weeks. <i>I</i> say
in ten days; I trust so.

<p class="left65"><span class="smcap">Futtehgurh</span>, <i>Jan. 30th</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Raikes tells me that he wrote to you immediately
after the action at Shumshabad, lest you should be made
unhappy by report. This was most kind and thoughtful
of him; and I do hope, therefore, that among so many
kind friends you will have been spared any unnecessary
pain. Everybody is very complimentary; even men I
never spoke to before. A flattering rascal told me he
considered it an "honor (forsooth!) to shake even my
left hand." I might become too proud with so much notice,
but the memory of 1854-55 is ever before me. The
Commander-in-Chief has been unable to move as yet, for
many reasons, but I fancy we shall march ere long. I
am wonderfully well, and the big wound is actually closing
already! is not that famous?</p>

<p><i>January 31st.</i>&mdash;I have been busy until post-time with
looking over poor Mac's things, and taking an inventory
of them for his mother. I am sure you will write to her
as soon as we can ascertain her address. We march on
towards Cawnpore to-morrow morning; it is a grief to
me to be disabled ever so little just at this time, but in a
very few days I shall be all right again.</p>

<p><i>January 31st.</i>&mdash;The Chief wont let me go on just
yet, though I really am perfectly able to do so. I am not
a bit the worse for these wounds, beyond the temporary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
inconvenience and disgust at being <i>hors de combat</i> in such
times as these. I look forward with the utmost pleasure
to seeing our friend Napier at Lucknow; I wish we
could hear from him. Inglis's despatch is, as you say,
most touching, and his conduct most admirable, as well
as hers. I always thought her a fine character.</p>

<p><i>February 1st and 2d.</i>&mdash;I am really doing very well,
and the wounds are healing wonderfully fast. In ten
days I hope to use my arm; they threatened me with six
weeks! I have indeed cause for gratitude, not only for
my preservation from greater evil, but for this rapid recovery;
happily I was in good health at the time, and
these wounds depend almost entirely on the state of the
blood. I shall remain here until the day after to-morrow,
and then accompany Brigadier Walpole's brigade to
join the Chief at Cawnpore. Colonel Burn drives me
along in a buggy; for though I <i>can</i> ride, it is not advisable
to run the risk of a shake. Every one is most
kind; Sir Colin markedly so. We are to have prize
money for Delhi after all; this will please as well as benefit
the army, the soldiers not being over-well contented
with the six months' batta, thinking that was all they
were to get. It is hardly, perhaps, to be expected that
the masses should be satisfied with the mere consciousness
of having done their duty through such months of
suffering as those before Delhi.</p>

<p>A soldier wrote upon the walls of the Delhi palace
(alluding to Lord Canning's foolish order about six
months' donation of batta, which is but thirty-six rupees
and some odd pence for each man):&mdash;</p>

<p>"For the salvation of India, the British soldier gets
thirty-six rupees ten annas, or one rupee one anna per
battle;" adding:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"When danger's rife and wars are nigh,</p>
<p>God and the soldier's all the cry:</p>
<p>When wars are o'er and matters righted,</p>
<p>God is forgotten and the soldier slighted."</p>
</div>

<p>Would you credit it? The Calcutta wiseacres sent up
orders to institute a strict inquiry who wrote this <i>jeu
d'esprit</i>. What nuts for the rascal who did it to see how
deep his hit had rankled!</p>

<p><i>February 3d.</i>&mdash;I am overwhelmed with letters of congratulation,
which I can only acknowledge by a few lines
in this sinister writing. Light has written very warmly,
also Lord William; you must thank them both for me at
present, as we march for Cawnpore early in the morning.
So I shall be at the capture of Lucknow after all! and
after that may God restore us to each other to part no
more!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camp, Jellalabad, on the Grand Trunk Road</span>,
<i>February 5th</i>.&mdash;We shall be at Cawnpore in four days
more, I trust. Nothing can be more favorable than the
state of my wounds, and I have felt scarcely any inconvenience
from travelling. I am fortunate in having
Colonel Burn for a travelling companion; pleasant, intelligent,
and warm-hearted. He drives me in his buggy,
and we breakfast together <i>al fresco</i>. Fancy the Carabineers
of poor Captain Wardlaw's squadron sending a
deputation, headed by a sergeant, to say on the part of
the men how grieved they were that I was hurt, and to
express their hope that I should soon be well and in the
field again. I confess these things are more gratifying to
me than any mention in despatches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camp, Meerun-ke-Serai</span>, <i>February 6th</i>.&mdash;We had
a very trying march this morning, a gale of wind bringing
up clouds of dust and grit, which cut one's face and eyes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
to pieces. I half wished I was a lady to wear a veil!
We overtook Maunsell, of the Engineers, who was so
badly wounded at Delhi, poor fellow; he is quite recovered,
but his handsome face a good deal disfigured by the
wound in his forehead. The Governor-General is at
Allahabad, and I believe Sir Colin is gone on to meet
him. I am doing well, and getting more handy in the
use of my left hand, but 'tis a cruel nuisance having only
one to resort to. The weather is getting warm very fast
in these parts, and I fear we shall have the hot weather
on us very soon. However, as soon as Lucknow has
finally fallen, I shall make every effort to get away to
organize and discipline my regiment, and for rest and
home for myself.</p>

<p><i>February 8th.</i>&mdash;I go on into Cawnpore in the morning,
making two marches in one; my arm has not been
going on quite so well the last three days, owing, the
doctor says, to the sharp wind. The wound on the thumb
is nearly closed, and I shall be all right, I hope, after two
or three days' quiet at Cawnpore. The getting up in the
cold mornings is very trying, now that I am unable to
ride or walk to get warm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cawnpore</span>, <i>February 10th</i>.&mdash;I got here in good time
yesterday, but was kept constantly at work fomenting
this tiresome arm, which had got somewhat inflamed from
the effects of the journey. To-day we cross the river, and
encamp a mile or two on the other side, and there I hope
to halt for a few days. I found letters here from Calcutta,
and have had a visit from Charles Harland, who
is as jolly and hearty as ever. Our friend (Napier) is
Chief Engineer with the force, and a Brigadier to boot.
I hope to see him in a day or two. I have not been to
the Chief's camp yet; it is a long way off, and my arm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
has prevented me doing anything. I shall be very thankful
when it is well, if but to use it for writing,&mdash;this left-handed
calligraphy is sad slow work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camp on the left bank of the Ganges</span>, <i>February
11th</i>.&mdash;I came across the river late in the evening,
and am very glad I did so, as the air is much purer, and
there is no dust. My arm is already better for the rest,
and I hope soon to be able to begin to use it. Do not
buoy yourself up with hope of honors for me. I shall
be a Brevet-Major, and nothing more I expect. It seems
the authorities here never sent home a list of men recommended
for honors; and the home authorities have
been waiting until they get one. "Hinc ill&aelig; lacrym&aelig;!"
And we shall all suffer by the delay in more ways than
one. But we are certainly to have prize money, and this,
with the batta, will take us home this time next year if
not sooner. Dear, dear home, sadly changed and contracted
since I left it, but home still, and dearer than ever
since the dearest part of myself will accompany me....
All old home memories were so vividly revived yesterday
by Charles Harland's visit, and an extract he read
me from a letter from his brother, describing the enthusiasm
of the old people at Colwich,<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> when the news
arrived that the King of Delhi was our prisoner, and
how they came to inquire whether it was really their
"Master William" who had done it? Bless their innocent
hearts, where was they riz? as &mdash;&mdash; would say. I
am sadly at a loss for a second in command, and do not
know whom to ask for, as officers are so scarce. I have
twice made an attempt to ask for Reginald to join me to
do duty, but my fears for you have made me hesitate;
and the lesson of the other day has taught me the fearful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
risk the dear boy would run in an irregular cavalry regiment,
with such work as mine. Still, if you and he wish
it, I will ask for him.</p>

<p><i>February 12th.</i>&mdash;Here I am, you see, writing (such
as it is) with my right hand once more. I am, indeed,
wonderfully better, and hope to be on horseback in a few
days. The scar on my arm is a very ugly one, and will
mark me for life; but then, as I am not a lady to wear
short sleeves, it does not signify. I was much disappointed
this morning to hear from Colonel Bevin, who
came out to see me, that Napier had been through our
camp this morning, not knowing I was here! He is in
Cawnpore, and the doctor wont let me go and see him
to-day, and we march on towards Lucknow to-morrow.
It will be some days yet before the whole force is collected
at Alumbagh. Captain Peel has just gone by
with his sailors and their enormous ship-guns, 68-pounders!
I have little doubt but that Lucknow will be in
our hands before another month is over; and then I shall
do my utmost to get my regiment sent back to Umb&acirc;la to
be formed and drilled, which it wants badly. I only
wonder it does as well as it is. I could hardly take any
other appointment, or even go home, until I had completed
this task; and I like my regiment, and what is
even more to the purpose, the regiment likes me, and
would follow me any and everywhere, I do believe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camp, Oonao</span>, <i>February 13th</i>.&mdash;Only a short letter
to-day, as I have been writing a right-handed one to
"O.," to satisfy the dear anxious hearts at home. I am
able to use my arm, but very gently, and shall ride to-morrow.
Oh, the pleasure of feeling myself on the
outside of a horse again!</p>

<p><i>February 14th.</i>&mdash;Your telegram has been going the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
rounds of all the camps before it found me out. Indeed,
you must not be anxious on my account, or listen to the
wild reports which are always rife. Be sure, if anything
were amiss, there are plenty of our friends here to send
you the truth. I could not dream of your coming to
Cawnpore. I would not hear of it even at Futtehgurh,
for, though your nursing and presence would be infinitely
precious to me, a camp is no fit place for you. I am,
indeed, going on wonderfully, and but for the attack of
inflammation I spoke of, and which turned out to be erysipelas,
I should have been quite well before this; and as
it is, I am actually nearer to a total cure than the men
(Sikhs even) who were wounded the same day. My abstinence
from spirit-drinking has stood me in good stead.</p>

<p><i>February 15th.</i>&mdash;No letters again to-day! I wish the
Commander-in-Chief would come out from Cawnpore,
and there would be some chance of better postal duty.
He is said to be waiting until the convoy of ladies from
Agra has passed down, lest anything should occur to disturb
the road where he had crossed into Oude with the
army,&mdash;a not unlikely thing to happen. I have just seen
a notice of my birth, parentage, and education, and services,
in the <i>Illustrated News</i>, as also Seaton's account of
the capture of the Princes. Strange to say, the former
is not wrong or exaggerated in any principal point. The
latter is also in the <i>Evening Mail</i>, and I have the honor
of appearing in big print in the leading article. I see
also a letter signed "A Civilian;" not a bad <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> in
its way. I can cock and fire a pistol with the right hand,
and am constantly working the arm about to prevent its
growing stiff; and I want to show how much the <i>will</i> has
to do with getting over these things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oonao</span>, <i>February 16th</i>.&mdash;I have this morning succeeded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
in exhuming four letters from the bottom of about
a hundred-weight of correspondence addressed to all parts
of the world; the bag was sent up here in the night for
people to find their letters as they could. Mine have
made me so happy. This has been a red-letter day too,
for I have at last seen our friend Napier. He rode out
here with Sir Colin, and I need not say how thoroughly
delighted I was to see him once more. He is looking
better but older than when we parted, but his charming,
affectionate manner is as nice as ever. God bless him!
I do love him dearly, as if he were indeed my born
brother. A note from him arrived while he was here;
it had been three days going ten miles! Sir Colin was
most kind and cordial, and prophesies I shall soon be
Lieut.-Colonel. I told him I feared there was small hope
of that, unless my majority could be counted as for the
Punjaub campaign, as Lord Dalhousie promised, but that
it had not been put on record. He immediately said,
"Oh, I'll do that with the greatest pleasure; let me have
a memorandum of your services, and I'll do all I can for
you, and I hope soon to shake hands with you as Lieut.-Colonel,
C. B., and Victoria Cross to boot." I confess I
liked this, because it was spontaneous; it is not the first
time I have heard a whisper about the Victoria Cross,
and I confess I do care most for this; I would rather
have it than be made a duke. My arm is going on admirably,
and you may be quite satisfied about me now
I am near our friend; he will always do what is kind,
that we may be quite sure of, and all that is best and tenderest
too, where you or I are concerned. I shall try to
get away immediately after Lucknow is taken, but I fear
every man may be needed for some time, even after that
much-desired event takes place.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camp, Oonao</span>, <i>February 17th</i>.&mdash;I grieve deeply at
your anxiety, and can scarcely understand your "terror
at the very name of Cawnpore and Lucknow," except for
what has passed. I am not nearly so much exposed to
peril here as at Delhi; the place, too, and time of year
are more healthy; so continue to "hope on," bravely
now as ever, until the end, which must be very soon....
I am going to spend to-morrow in Cawnpore with
Napier, and have a big talk. The delay in the brevet
is an accident, <i>not</i> owing to the home authorities. It
has gone home now, and my name is in it, Sir Colin
told me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cawnpore</span>, <i>February 19th</i>.&mdash;I shall ride back to
Oonao early to-morrow morning; the temptation of Napier's
society was irresistible; it is such a pleasure to
see him again. There will be no move hence until the
23d, I think, though it is getting rapidly hot in this hateful
place; but on the other side the river it is cool, and
Lucknow is even more so, I hear. Osborn Wilkinson
has been here, and has gone on towards Alumbagh. I
shall try and get him for my regiment, if but to do duty;
he is a fine fellow and thorough soldier.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oonao</span>, <i>February 20th</i>.&mdash;I rode out from Cawnpore
this morning; Colonels Napier and Lugard accompanying
me for some miles,&mdash;the latter only arrived yesterday;
he is to command a division as Brigadier-General,
I am glad to say. Our friend is nicer than ever, and
looking well.</p>

<p><i>February 21st.</i>&mdash;As far as I can learn, we (<i>i.e.</i>, my
Horse) shall have but little to do with the actual capture
or assault of Lucknow, and I fancy our duty will be protecting
the flanks and rear of the army from incursions
of the enemy's cavalry, &amp;c. General Lugard came out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
this morning to take the command. I hope Napier will
soon follow. I am very anxious to get on and get the
affair over.</p>

<p><i>February 22d.</i>&mdash;There is not a particle of news of
any kind. I had an attack of fever last night, but it is
gone this morning, and I am all right again; the wound
on my arm is quite closed, and the last bandage discarded;
the thumb is still very stiff, and the joint much enlarged.
My wounds have healed with unprecedented rapidity; and
I cannot be sufficiently grateful that I am so soon enabled
to return to my duty. Dear Douglas Seaton has been
very ill again, and unable to leave England, as he intended,
poor fellow. I believe half his illness is caused
by fretting at being away from his regiment now it is in
the field; but he never could have stood the trial of those
months before Delhi. The Commander-in-Chief tells me
that, despairing of getting the list of recommendations
for Delhi from India, the Duke of Cambridge is making
out a list himself from the despatches, to be corrected
hereafter if any omissions occur. The next mail may,
therefore, make me a Major, as I was mentioned even in
Wilson's despatches. God grant I may be able to get
home; that is my great desire now.</p>

<p><i>February 23d.</i>&mdash;It is midnight, and we march for
Alumbagh at 4 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>; so I write a line at once to say I
am doing well, and will send a telegram if anything occurs,
which I do not expect yet. There has been a big
fight, within a few miles of us, between the force under
General Hope Grant and the rebels, and there was a
bigger on Sunday at Lucknow with Sir James Outram's
force. I have got hold of a strip of newspaper this
morning, with Brigadier Hope's Shumshabad despatch, in
which I figure so prominently that I am inclined to indorse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
it "Hope told a flattering tale," and send it home
to the dear girls. The convoy arrived this morning
(<i>i.e.</i>, the ladies, &amp;c.) from Agra, so I hope the Chief
will move soon. I was out all the morning with General
Lugard, and was surprised to find how hot the weather is
getting (in the sun) even here; but I am quite well&mdash;quite.
</p>

<p>In a letter of this date to the Chaplain of the
Lawrence Asylum, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

... I have only to add that in gratitude for the many
and unspeakable mercies which I have received during

<p>We arrived here last night at dusk, after a terribly
dusty march of thirty-six miles. To-day we had a bit
of a fight. The Pandies, ignorant of the reinforcements
which had arrived, had as usual come round one flank
of the camp, so we moved out and caught them as they
were trying to get back again, and took two of their guns.
By "we," I mean my own men and the Military Train
men from home. Young Gough, my adjutant, was
wounded, and had his horse shot. I was luckily in the
way, or it would have gone worse with him;<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> my own
horse too (pretty "Child of the Desert") was wounded,
and I was obliged to mount a sowar's horse. Gough will
be laid up for a month, I fear; it is a flesh wound in
the thigh. I do not think Master Pandy will try the
same trick again. We have been out so long that there
is time for no more to-day than this assurance of my
safety.

<p>
<span class="smcap">Alumbagh</span>, <i>February 25th</i>.&mdash;I have been calling on
Sir James Outram this morning, and had a most pleasant
interview; the brave old warrior greeted me most cordially,
professing his satisfaction at having <i>at last</i> met one
of whom he had heard so much, &amp;c. &amp;c. The pleasure
was certainly mutual, for I have long wished to meet <i>him</i>.
He made many inquiries about you also, and asked
whether you had not been in the hills during the panic,
and helped the refugees, &amp;c. How proudly I could
answer all his praise in the affirmative. He also asked
my opinion of Lord William's administration, and I was
glad of the opportunity to testify in his favor. Altogether
this good old soldier's compliments were pleasing to me,
particularly as he was not one of those who in my time
of trouble passed me by on the other side.</p>

<p>The enemy is quite quiet to-day. I fancy we were too
much for his philosophy yesterday. Fancy the Queen
Regnant coming out on an elephant to meet us, to encourage
her wavering followers! I wish the Chief would
make haste and finish this business, it is getting cruelly
hot already.</p>

<p><i>27th.</i>&mdash;All quiet still with the enemy. A packet of
letters has arrived, and brought me all the comfort I am
capable of receiving in this torturing absence; would it
were over! I hear the Chief has crossed the Ganges
and is coming on here. I believe we had some <span class="greek" title="kudos">&#954;&#8166;&#948;&#959;&#962;</span> for
the affair of the 25th, though beyond being exposed to
a very galling fire, I did not think much of it myself.
Gough's wound is a serious misfortune to me just now;
a gallant, go-a-head boy like him is not to be easily replaced,
any more than poor Mac is. I myself am laid
up with a sore leg; I would not nurse it at first, and now
it is so painful I cannot mount my horse or even stand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
without pain, so I shall go into the next scrimmage on an
elephant! Dr. Brougham, however, says it will be well
in four or five days. I did not know Greville was going
home so soon, I hoped to have shaken him by the <i>sain</i>
hand once more before we parted for so long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alumbagh</span>, <i>1st March</i>.&mdash;Nothing of public importance
is occurring. I am still unable to ride, so I do
regimental work. I dined with Sir J. Outram (he is the
General commanding here) and with Colonel Haggart,
7th Hussars, last night; the former is quite affectionate
in his manner to me. He would quite charm you, and
were I not out of love with vanity, would spoil me; but
I confess the respectful homage of the soldiers is pleasanter
to my spirit than the praise of great men. I study
to be quiet and do my own business without elation and
pride, satisfied with the testimony of my own conscience
that I strive to do my duty.</p>

<p><i>March 2d.</i>&mdash;The Commander-in-Chief arrived with a
large part of the force this morning, marched straight
through our camp, and <i>at</i> the enemy (who of course ran
away), and occupied the Dilkoosha, a large garden-house
and park near the city. My unfortunate leg prevented
my sharing in the fray, I grieve to say, and I am actually
in a fright lest he (the Chief) should take Lucknow
before I am able to ride!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alumbagh</span>, <i>March 6th</i>.&mdash;I had time for but the
merest line yesterday, written from Dilkoosha, where
the Commander-in-Chief is encamped, and whither we
were erroneously brought yesterday to return here to-day.
I had a long talk with Sir Colin, who was even
more than commonly kind and cordial. I am not very
well, I am sorry to say; this leg troubles me, and is the
effect of the erysipelas which attacked my arm in consequence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
of the wounds closing too quickly. The truth is
that I lost about a pound and a half of blood when I was
wounded, and having had two slight bouts of fever since,
I am not so strong as I would be; however, I am getting
on, and am dosed with steel, quinine, and port wine <i>ad lib</i>.
My arm is pretty well, but the wound opened again partially
after the 25th, and I have been obliged to submit to
bandages, &amp;c.; still I hope three or four days will set me
all right again, though I fear the arm will never be quite
straight again, or the thumb quite flexible. I shall have
to go home for rest to my body, if not for comfort to my
heart. I have seen Osborn Wilkinson; he is as nice as
possible, and he is now Deputy Assistant Quartermaster-General
to the Cavalry Brigade, to which my Horse is
attached, so I hope to see more of him than of late. I
breakfasted yesterday at head-quarters with Napier, and
grieved to see that he looked worn and troubled. I fear
his health is very precarious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Camp, near Lucknow</span>, <i>March 6th</i>.&mdash;... I grieve
that you should be anxious on my account; the same
merciful Providence which has so wonderfully preserved
us both through so many and great dangers, will, I earnestly
pray, continue the same gracious guardianship; yet
I strive to be prepared for all....</p>

<p>I had to march again this morning; a message from
Sir Colin last night to the Brigadier having directed him
to put me in charge of the line of communications with
Jellalabad, the Alumbagh, and his camp. So I had to
bring my men up here, half-way between the two camps,
and to make arrangements for insuring the safety of the
roads, and protecting the convoys on which the existence
of the army depends. The worst part of it is I cannot
ride, and have had, for the first time in my life, to do outpost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
duty in a dog-cart! <i>driving</i> across country to post
videttes and picquettes, &amp;c. What with this continued
movement and the rest which I am <i>compelled</i> to take recumbent,
I have had no time for writing as I fain would
do. I have heard from Reginald; he is so earnest in his
wish to do duty with my regiment, that I have asked for
him. May God preserve the dear boy from all evil! I
shall never forgive myself if harm comes to him. There
is no decided move at present; the net is gradually closing
round the enemy, some of the Goorkhas and Brigadier
Frank's column having already arrived. You must
not expect more than a Majority for me yet, though I
have good reason to believe that more will come.</p>

<p><i>March 8th.</i>&mdash;I went up myself to-day to the head-quarters'
camp, to look for letters and see our friend, but
failed in both; but I breakfasted and had a long chat with
that pleasantest of persons, Lugard, now Sir Edward, and
while there I had a letter from Norman to say that Reginald
had been appointed to do duty with my Horse. I
can but think he is too young; but if he must see hard
service so early, better with me than elsewhere. God
grant it may be for his good. I am looking for the end
with an eager longing for rest which I cannot control.
Dear Sir Henry used to say I was ambitious, and I know
I was proud and thirsty of success; but now all desires
for the future settle down into the one thought of home.</p>

<p><i>March 9th.</i>&mdash;I grieve that report should cause you
fear and anxiety whenever there has been a fight, particularly
as the chances are against my being in it. You
should remember that our force extends now round three
sides nearly of Lucknow. The extreme right of our position,
or rather camps, being at least nine miles from the
left; so that engagements occur at one part which those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
at the other never perhaps hear of till next day! This
was the case with the Dilkoosha affair. The Chief passed
our camp on the left, moved on some miles, and occupied
"Dilkoosha" (a fine palace, three stories high), and the
ground up to the banks of the Goomtee, almost without
opposition. I was never within miles of him. Indeed,
I have not been on horseback since the 25th, as I am
forced to save myself for emergencies. If anything important
occurs, be sure I will send a telegram somehow.
I have written to Reginald, and sent him a copy of the
General Order appointing him to do duty with my regiment.
I have also got a Lieutenant Meecham, of the
Madras army,&mdash;a great artist and good-looking fellow,
and, what is much more to my purpose, a fine soldier I
believe. I have also asked for young Blackburne, whom
you may remember in the 20th Native Infantry at Peshawur,&mdash;a
friend of Edward Loyd's. He is much
"come out" since then. I do hope Hugh Gough will
soon be well; I do ill without such a dashing fine fellow.</p>

<p>In the affair of the 25th we were leading, and took the
guns,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, we fairly captured one, and drove the enemy
away from the other, and kept them at bay until the
"train" came up and secured it. I was not altogether
satisfied with my men in this part of the affair. They
hesitated, and let me go ahead unsupported except by
Nihal Singh; old Mahommed Reza Khan, and one or
two others, with Gough, being near. The consequence
was that the enemy concentrated their fire on our little
party. However, the Europeans of the Military Train
hesitated to do what I wanted <i>my</i> men to do, and they
behaved very well immediately afterwards. There has
been a great fuss about the matter; Sir Colin having
taken great and very just offence at its being reported to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>
him that the cavalry were "led" by Colonel &mdash;&mdash;, a staff-officer....
He got wounded, and then was officially
reported to have "led the cavalry," whereas we had
Brigadier Campbell (a capital officer), and Colonel Haggart,
of the 7th Hussars, present, besides the officers
commanding regiments, "quorum pars fui." Sir Colin
denounced Colonel &mdash;&mdash;'s "leading" as "an insufferable
impertinence," called me up, and asked me before them
all, "Were you present with your regiment on the 25th?"
and on my saying, "Yes," he cried out, "Now, look here;
look at my friend Hodson here, does <i>he</i> look like a man
that needs 'leading?' Is that a man likely to want
'leading?' I should like to see the fellow who'd presume
to talk of 'leading' <i>that</i> man!" pointing to me, and
so forth. I nearly went into convulsions; it was <i>such</i> a
scene....</p>

<p>The Martini&egrave;re was taken to-day without loss except
poor Captain Peel, who, I grieve to say, is wounded.</p>

<p><i>March 10th.</i>&mdash;The mail is come with my Majority.
The brevet has given general dissatisfaction. Some of
the double honors are marvellous; but it should be remembered
that these promotions are given <i>sponte su&acirc;</i> by
the home authorities, no recommendations having gone
from hence till lately. I am content myself, having no
interest. It proves they perceive I have done something,
or I should not have this beginning; and it is satisfactory
to find that it is universally considered that I have been
shabbily used. Better this by far than to have people
lifting up their eyes and saying I had got too much!
Inglis is justly rewarded, and some others. I dare say
more will come with time. I hope devoutly that when
Lucknow falls I shall be released. We shall know in a
few days,&mdash;for even while I write Lucknow seems to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
"falling" fast. Immense progress was made yesterday,
with not more loss than some 18 or 20 wounded, and I
hear to-day they are going ahead again. Pandy has
quite given up fighting, except pot-shots under cover, and
runs at the very sight of troops advancing. I stood on
the top of the Dilkoosha palace yesterday, and watched
the capture of as strong a position as men could wish for
(which at Delhi would have cost us hundreds) without
the enemy making a single struggle or firing a shot. At
this rate Lucknow will soon be in our hands. We (of
the cavalry) are kept on the <i>qui vive</i> watching the southern
outlets from the town to prevent escape, and I expect
to see Lucknow taken without being under fire again.
Well, it must be confessed that I have had my share of
the dangers of the war, and whether I receive honors or
not, I have the testimony of my own conscience that I
have done one man's work towards the restoration of our
power in India.... I have been occupied to-day
in trying to get the Victoria Cross for the two Goughs.
Hugh certainly ought to have it.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p><i>March 11th.</i>&mdash;Just as I sit down to write comes an
order to move our camp towards Alumbagh again; Jung
Bahadoor having at last arrived with his army and taken
up ground between me and the enemy.... If anything
occurs, I will get Colonel Napier or Norman to
send you a service telegram....
</p>
</div>

<p>This was the last letter which my brother wrote.
Having given directions to his Adjutant, Lieutenant
Gough, he said he would ride on and look out
a nice spot for their new camping-ground, and be
back in time to march with them. On his way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
he heard firing, and riding forward, found that the
Begum's Palace was to be attacked. He immediately
rode to the place, and finding his friend
Brigadier Napier directing the attack, said laughingly,
"I am come to take care of you; you have
no business to go to work without me to look
after you." The assault was successful.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> He
entered the breach with General Napier and several
others. In a few minutes they were separated
in the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i>, and General Napier saw nothing
more of him till he was sent for to him
"dangerously wounded." The surgeon of his
regiment gives the following account:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"We struck our tents and were saddled, waiting for
him till it became so dark that we were forced to go without
him, and reached our ground after sunset. I had
gone to the post-office and was five minutes behind the
regiment. When I came up, I found that Hodson's orderly
had come in great haste, saying that his master had
sent for me, but with no other message. He said that
his master had been hit when advancing with the troops
on the Begum's Kotee on foot.</p>

<p>"I mounted and rode off with him at once. From the
darkness of the night and the difficulty of passing the
Goorkah sentries, I did not get to Dilkooshah till 9 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
There no one knew where he was. I then went on to
the artillery mess and learnt that he was in Banks's
House which I reached about 10 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> I found him in a
dooly and Dr. Sutherland with him, whom I at once relieved,
and learnt the following particulars from him and
from the orderly who remained with Hodson, and who
had been by his side when hit. He had arrived at
Banks's House just as the party going to attack the
Begum's Palace were starting, and fell in with them.
The place had been taken before he was wounded.
When the soldiers were searching for concealed Sepoys
in the court-yard and buildings adjoining, he said to his
orderly, 'I wonder if any of the rascals are in there.'
He turned the angle of the passage; looked into a dark
room, which was full of Sepoys; a shot was fired from
inside. He staggered back some paces and then fell. A
party of Highlanders, hearing who had been hit, rushed
into the room and bayoneted every man there.</p>

<p>"The orderly, a large powerful Sikh, carried him in
his arms out of danger, and got a dooly and brought him
back to Banks's House, where his wound was looked to
and dressed.</p>

<p>"He was shot through the right side of the chest, in
the region of the liver, the ball entering in front and
going out behind. There had been profuse bleeding, and
I saw that the wound was most likely mortal.</p>

<p>"He was very glad to see me, and began talking of
his wound, which he thought himself was mortal. I lay
beside him on the ground all night, holding his hand, on
account of the great pain he suffered. He was very
weak when I arrived, but by means of stimulants rallied
wonderfully, and slept for an hour or two during the
night. At daylight he was much better, his hands were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
warm and his pulse good, and I had hopes that, if the
bleeding, which had ceased, did not return, he might recover.
He drank two cups of tea, and said he felt very
well. His account of his being wounded agreed with the
orderly's.</p>

<p>"About 9 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> I had the dooly lifted into a room,
which I had had cleared out, where he was much quieter.
At 10 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>, however, bleeding came on again profusely,
and he rapidly became worse. I told him that recovery
was impossible. He then sent for General Napier, to
whom he gave directions about his property and messages
to his wife. After this he rapidly sank, though
he remained sensible and was able to speak till a quarter
past one, when he became too weak; and at twenty-five
minutes past one died.</p>

<p>"His orderly<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> actually cried over him, he was so attached
to him.</p>

<p>"He was buried that evening by the Rev. Dr. Smith.
The Commander-in-Chief and his staff were present."
</p>
</div>

<p>General Napier says, in a letter to Mrs. Hodson:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"I regret bitterly now, that I did not insist on your
dear husband going back, but you know how impossible
it was to check his dauntless spirit."
</p>
</div>

<p>He and others who were present give the following
particulars:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
... "He lay on his bed of mortal agony and met
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
death with the same calm composure which so much distinguished
him on the field of battle. He was quite conscious
and peaceful, occasionally uttering a sentence:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'My poor wife,' 'My poor sisters.'</p>

<p>"'I should have liked to see the end of the campaign
and gone home to the dear ones once more, but it was so
ordered.'</p>

<p>"'It is hard to leave the world just now, when success
is so near, but God's will be done.'</p>

<p>"'Bear witness for me that I have tried to do my duty
to man. May God forgive my sins for Christ's sake.' 'I
go to my Father.'</p>

<p>"'My love to my wife; tell her my last thoughts were
of her.' 'Lord, receive my soul.'</p>

<p>"These were his last words, and, without a sigh or
struggle, his pure and noble spirit took its flight."
</p>
</div>

<p>Thus, on the 12th of March, 1858, in his thirty-seventh
year, closed the earthly career of one of
the best and bravest of England's sons, one of
her truest heroes, of whom it may be said,&mdash;"Quanquam
medio in spatio integr&aelig; &aelig;tatis ereptus,
quantum ad gloriam longissimum &aelig;vum
peregit."</p>

<p>Great and irreparable as was his loss to his
family and his friends, as a husband, a brother,
and a friend, I believe that, at the particular
juncture at which he was taken away, it was
still greater, as a soldier, to his country. It
would be difficult to overestimate the value of
the services which he might have rendered, if
spared, in the pacifying of Oude after the capture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>
of Lucknow, or the influence which he
might have had on the fortunes of the war. One
of those best qualified to judge declared, that
"Hodson with his regiment would have been
worth 10,000 men." His peculiar qualifications
for Asiatic warfare would have found an appropriate
field for their display.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary, however, for me to attempt
to pronounce his eulogium. This has been done
by those more capable of forming an estimate of
his rare excellence as a soldier, and of doing it
justice by their words.</p>

<p>Sir Colin Campbell, in a letter of condolence
to his widow, thus expressed himself:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left45">
"<span class="smcap">Martini&egrave;re</span>, <i>March 13, 1858</i>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,&mdash;It is with a sentiment of profound regret
that I am compelled to address you for the purpose of
communicating the sad news that your gallant and distinguished
husband, Major Hodson, received a mortal
wound from a bullet on the 11th instant. He unfortunately
accompanied his friend Brigadier Napier, commanding
Engineers in the successful attack on the Begum's
Palace. The whole army, which admired his
talents, his bravery, and his military skill, deplores his
loss, and sympathizes with you in your irreparable bereavement.
I attended your husband's funeral yesterday
evening, in order to show what respect I could to the
memory of one of the most brilliant officers under my
command.</p>

<p class="left45">
(Signed)
<span class="i4 smcap">"C. Campbell</span>,<br />
<span class="i4">"<i>Com.-in-Chief in East Indies</i>."</span></p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span></p>

<p>An officer who was present at the funeral
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"When the part of the service came where the body
is lowered into the grave, all the old warrior's courage
and self-possession could no longer control the tears,&mdash;undeniable
evidence of what he felt. 'I have lost one of
the finest officers in the army,' was his remark to General
Napier."
</p>
</div>

<p>Even Sir John Lawrence, no friendly judge,
pronounced him in an official paper to be&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"One of the ablest, most active, and bravest soldiers
who have fallen in the present war."
</p>
</div>

<p>Sir R. Montgomery says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"I look round and can find no one like him. Many
men are as brave, many possess as much talent, many are
as cool and accurate in judgment, but not one combines
all these qualifications as he did."
</p>
</div>

<p>I shall best give an idea of the universal feeling
of regret awakened at the tidings of his death by
subjoining a few extracts from the public press
at home and abroad, and from private letters.
The Bombay correspondent of the <i>Times</i>, after
detailing the assault on the Begum's Palace,
wrote thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"At this point fell, mortally wounded, Hodson of the
1st Bengal Fusileers; Hodson of Hodson's Horse; Hodson,
the captor of the King of Delhi and the princes of his
house. Few of the many losses that have occurred during
the operations consequent upon the mutinies, have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>
caused such universal regret throughout India as the
death of this excellent officer; and among those in England
who have read of and admired his exploits, not only
his comrades of the Sikh battle-fields, but many an old
friend at Rugby or at Trinity will mourn that his career
has been thus early closed."
</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Times</i>, in a leading article, thus announced
his death:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"The country will receive with lively regret the news
that the gallant Major Hodson, who has given his name
to an invincible and almost ubiquitous body of cavalry,
was killed in the attack on Lucknow. Major Hodson
has been from the very beginning of this war fighting
everywhere and against any odds with all the spirit of a
Paladin of old. His most remarkable exploit, the capture
of the King of Delhi and his two sons, astonished
the world by its courage and coolness. Hodson was,
indeed, a man who, from his romantic daring and his
knowledge of the Asiatic character, was able to beat the
natives at their own weapons. We could better have
spared an older and more highly placed officer."
</p>
</div>

<p>The following notice appeared in a Bombay
paper:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"From a Lucknow letter which we publish to-day our
readers will learn, with sorrow and regret, that that most
able and gallant officer, Captain Hodson, who has distinguished
himself on so many occasions since the breaking
out of the rebellion, and whose services have been of so
brilliant and valuable a character, has been killed at
Lucknow. As a leader of Irregular Horse, or indeed as
a soldier of any of the non-scientific forces, Captain Hodson
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
was almost without an equal. He was one of those
squadron leaders which the Indian army can alone rear
up. There are few men who would have managed the
capture of the ex-King of Delhi as this departed hero
did. On that occasion his force was small compared to
that he had to cope with; but the determined daring of
the man made up for the disparity, and the old King
came out of his fortification&mdash;for a strong fortification it
was&mdash;and surrendered. So also with the capture of the
King's sons, who also surrendered themselves, but whom
Hodson found rescued when he reached them, after
having completed the disarming of their band. That
was a moment to test a man. But he of whom we write
was equal to the emergency. The carts in which the
princes were, were retaken immediately. Still the aspect
of the armed Mahomedan crowd around&mdash;growing every
moment more numerous&mdash;was dark and threatening. It
was a situation which required prompt decision, and
promptly did the British leader decide. He saw that it
was necessary that his prisoners should die, and resolved
himself to become their executioner: a wise resolve, for,
probably, had he asked one of his own Mahomedan
troopers to kill the sons of the Mogul, a refusal would
have followed, and that refusal might have been acted up
to by all. He adopted the wiser course, harangued his
men, ordered the prisoners to take off their robes in the
cart, and shot them with his own hand. Had the prisoners
been allowed to leave the cart, their bodies would
have been left behind; for to touch them would, by the
troopers, have been considered defilement, and, left behind,
they might have been fanatically paraded through
the country as an incitement to a fresh rising. Besides,
it was necessary that their remains should be exposed at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>
the Kotwallie in Delhi with something of the indignity
they themselves had caused to be inflicted on the murdered
victims of the 11th of May."
</p>
</div>

<p>Another published a letter with this sentence:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Hodson, splendid fellow, died the following day, most
deeply regretted by all ranks in his regiment. He indeed
was a brave soldier, a clever and truly esteemed commander.
May we not say he was one of the flowers of
the 'old Europeans,' and an ornament to the Bengal
army?"

<p>The writer (in <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>) of a
series of papers on the 1st Fusileers, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Then fell one of the bravest in the Indian army, an
officer whose name has been brought too often before the
public by those in high command to need my humble
word in praise. There was not a man before Delhi who
did not know Hodson; always active, always cheery, it
did one's heart good to look at his face, when all felt how
critical was our position. Ask any soldier who was the
bravest man before Delhi, who most in the saddle, who
foremost? and nine out of ten in the Infantry will tell
you Hodson, in the Artillery as many will name Tombs.</p>

<p>"I once heard one of the Fusileers say, 'Whenever
I sees Captain Hodson go out, I always prays for him,
for he is sure to be in danger.' Yet it was not only in
the field that Hodson was to be valued, his head was as
active as his hand was strong, and I feel sure, when we
who knew him heard of his death, not one but felt that
there was a vacancy indeed in our ranks."</p>

<p>The <i>Times</i> correspondent, (Mr. Russell,) in his
letter of March 13th, writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"When I returned to head-quarters' camp this evening,
I found that poor Hodson had died the previous day, and
been buried the same evening.</p>

<p>"He was a zealous and accomplished officer, of great
bravery, ability, and determination, an excellent judge of
the native character, of a humane and clement disposition,
but firm in the infliction of deserved punishment.</p>

<p>"The last time I saw him alive he expressed a decided
opinion that Government must resort to an amnesty, or
be prepared for a long continuance of disturbances."
</p>
</div>

<p>From the <i>Delhi Gazette</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"He was a perfect gentleman, an accomplished scholar,
and we need scarcely add, (what our columns have so
often recorded,) one of the most brilliant soldiers in this
or any other army. His death is not only a severe family
affliction, but a national calamity, and it will be long before
the name of the capturer of the King and princes of
Delhi will cease to be mentioned with honor, and remembered
with regret."
</p>
</div>

<p>From private letters of condolence, which would
fill a volume, I select a few passages, in which
the writers seem to have seized with great felicity
upon some of the more remarkable features in my
brother's character and actions.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"It is hard to lose one upon whom all eyes were fixed,
and whose noble qualities seemed so certain of recognition,
and of speedy advancement to such employments as
his fine natural abilities well fitted him to discharge.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>
"The very presence of such a man in India was an
element of power apart from all official rank, and he
could ill be spared from among the very few who have
learnt to impersonate in themselves the power of the
English nation, and to let the natives of India feel the
irresistible character of that power. You must have
watched him so anxiously and so proudly that, though
thousands of us have done the same, none can approach
the measure of your sorrow or mourn as you that he can
confer no more honor on your name, but that the opportunities
of the future must be reaped by other and less
capable hands.</p>

<p>"I cannot feel easy without expressing to you the
great grief and consternation with which I read the account
of your brother's death. Certainly it would have
been little less than miraculous if, being what he was, he
had lived out this war. And yet I, for one, had always
cherished a hope that I might have seen once more with
my own eyes so noble and gallant a soldier.</p>

<p>"There is, after all, something about skilful courage
which draws the heart to itself more than eloquence, or
learning, or anything else, and your brother seems to have
been endued with this almost more than any living Englishman,
brave as our countrymen are."
</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"Closely have I watched, during these last few sad
months, the career of that brave brother of yours. I
could estimate his bold and self-sacrificing courage, and
knowing as I did the sort of people over whom he had
acquired such perfect sway, I knew how much a clear
and commanding intellect must have been called into exercise,
to aid a strong and devoted heart. What victims
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>
has Lucknow offered up to the fiendish treachery of those
ungrateful men&mdash;Lawrence! Havelock! and Hodson!"
</p>
</div>

<hr class="l15" />

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"My grief is not for him; he had done his work in
that station of life in which God had placed him, nobly,
heartily, and as in the sight of God (would that we all
did our work in half such a Christian spirit); but for
you all, who were looking forward to seeing him again,
crowned with the honors he had so hardly won. Well, it
has pleased God that this was not to be; but there is a
good hope, more than a hope, that a reward of a higher
kind is his."
</p>
</div>

<p>From one who had known him in India:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"From the love and esteem I bore your brother, you
will, I feel sure, allow me to write and express, however
imperfectly words can do it, my deep and heartfelt sympathy
with you and your sisters under this heavy blow.
Our acquaintance was not of long standing, but had rapidly
ripened into intimacy, and I look back to the days
spent in his society as amongst my happiest in India. His
very presence was sunshine.</p>

<p>"Of my admiration for his talents, and the service he
rendered his country, it would be impertinent to speak,&mdash;they
are of public note; but of the tender sympathies,
the ready advice, the forgetfulness of self, and the ever-mindfulness
of others, I may testify. His was, indeed,
a rare and beautiful character, and the better he was
known the more he could not fail to be appreciated."
</p>
</div>

<p>I will add one more letter from General Johnstone,
which will show that even to the last my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>
brother was pursued by the same jealousy and
malignity which had caused him so much suffering
in former years:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"He was too noble to pass through the world without
detractors. The ambitious and brave envied him, because
the brilliancy of his acts put theirs in the shade;
I mean, those not possessed of the disinterestedness of
Christians.</p>

<p>"The mean and despicable hated him, because they
quailed before the eagle eye that could endure neither
dishonesty nor cowardice. Their base slanders were in
whispers during his life; now that his gallant spirit is
gone, they come forward in unblushing malignity. I
heard the whispers only; my indignation at learning the
baseness with which this true hero has been treated is
beyond all my powers of expression."
</p>
</div>

<p>Some of my readers may be interested in a
description of Major Hodson's personal appearance
and manner, given in a letter describing a
visit which he paid the writer a few years previously
at Calcutta:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"He was remarkably well made, lithe, and agile; in
height about five feet eleven inches. His hair had slightly
receded from a high and most intellectual forehead, and
was light and curly. His eyes were blue, but animated by
a peculiarly determined, and sometimes even fierce look,
which would change to one of mischievous merriment,
for he was keenly susceptible of the ridiculous, in whatever
shape it presented itself; but usually his look impressed
me at once with that idea of his determination and
firmness which have ever characterized his actions. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>
nose was inclining to the aquiline, and the curved, thin
nostrils added a look of defiance in noways counteracted
by the compressed lips, which seemed to denote many an
inward struggle between duty and inclination. These
are my impressions of Hodson as I last saw him; and if
you add to this an open, frank manner, that, <i>bongr&eacute; malgr&eacute;</i>,
impressed you favorably at first sight with the owner,
you will have the charming <i>ensemble</i> that presides over
my recollections of three as happy weeks as I ever
passed."
</p>
</div>

<p>As a pendant to this portrait I give another
from a lady's pen, drawn more recently:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"There was an indescribable charm of manner about
him, combining all the gentle playfulness of the boy, the
deep tenderness of the woman, and the vigorous decision
of the soldier.</p>

<p>"His powers of attraction extended even to animals;
and it was touching to see his large white Persian cat
following him from room to room, escaping from the caresses
of others to nestle by him. I have often watched
the pretty creature as he threw himself, exhausted with
the day's work, on an easy chair or sofa, rubbing himself
against his master, whisking the long white tail against
his fair moustache, and courting the endearments liberally
bestowed. Restless with others, pussy was at rest if
established by him.</p>

<p>"At Delhi there was a wild, shy little kitten, which
fled from every one else, but mewed provokingly whenever
he appeared,&mdash;would jump on his knee with all the
familiarity of an old friend.</p>

<p>"With his horses he had the same power of domestication.
They yielded to the sound of his voice with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>
instinct that seemed to convey to all that in him they had
found master and friend.</p>

<p>"Over the natives that influence seemed almost magic.
When at Umb&acirc;la, on ten days' leave, in November last,
the wounded and convalescent Guides (his old corps)
were all day straying into the compound simply to 'salaam'
the 'Sahib.' And if, when lingering on the steps,
or in front of the study door, they were questioned what
they wanted, their answer would be, 'Nothing; they
liked to look at the Sahib.' And so they hung about his
steps, and watched like so many faithful dogs. Especially
there was an Affghan boy, (he had once been a
slave,) whose very soul seemed bound up in the master
who had rescued him from his degraded position, and for
whom every service seemed light. He would watch his
master's movements with a look of very worship, as if the
ground were not good enough for him to tread.</p>

<p>"His joyousness of nature made him the most charming
companion. There was a certain quaintness of expression
which gave zest to all he said; and yet there
was a reverence, too, so that, were subjects graver than
usual introduced even by allusion, they at once commanded
his earnest response."
</p>
</div>

<p>It will doubtless excite surprise, perchance indignation,
that one whom the Commander-in-Chief
pronounced "one of the most brilliant
soldiers under his command,"&mdash;one whom all
ranks of the army in India reckoned amongst
their bravest and most skilful leaders,&mdash;one
whom the popular voice has already enrolled
amongst the heroes of the nation,&mdash;one whose
name was "known, either in love or fear, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>
every native from Calcutta to Cabul,"&mdash;should
have received, with the exception of a brevet
majority (to which he was entitled for services in
1849), no mark of his Sovereign's approbation,
no recognition of gallant services and deeds of
daring, one tenth part of which would have covered
many of Fortune's favorites with decorations.</p>

<p>That recognition, however, which was officially
withheld, has been given in a more marked form
by the spontaneous expression of the feelings of
his brothers-in-arms. A committee, composed of
officers of the highest eminence, has been formed
at Calcutta for the sake of recording, by some
permanent memorial, their admiration of his gallantry
and skill, and it has been determined that
it should take the form of a monument in Lichfield
Cathedral.</p>

<p>Nor will his name be forgotten in India, even
by men in office. The regiment which he raised
still is "Hodson's Horse;" and by an order, published
in the <i>Gazette</i> of August 13th, is constituted
a brigade, consisting of the 1st, 2d, and 3d
Regiments of "Hodson's Horse."</p>

<p>I do not know that his warmest friends could
desire any more distinguished testimony to his
services.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>Since these remarks were written, my brother's
services have received a still more public acknowledgment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>
On the occasion of the vote of
thanks to the Indian Army, on 14th April, 1859,
both Lord Derby in the Upper, and Lord Stanley
in the Lower House, mentioned his name in the
most honorable manner.</p>

<p>Lord Stanley spoke as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"And now, Sir, having paid the tribute that is due to
those who live, it is not fitting that we should pass away
entirely from this subject without recognizing the services
of the dead. (Hear, hear.) Operations like those which
have been carried on for the last eighteen months, could
not be conducted without a great and lamentable loss of
life, and their loss to the public service is not one which
can be measured by any numerical test, because it is
always the best and bravest officers who rush to the front,&mdash;who
volunteer for every service of danger or difficulty,
who expose themselves to every risk, and among whom,
therefore, there is necessarily the greatest loss of life.
There are two names which are especially distinguished.
The first is that of Major Hodson, of the Guides, (hear,
hear,) who in his short but brilliant military career displayed
every quality which an officer should possess.
(Hear.) Nothing is more remarkable, in glancing over
the biography of Major Hodson that has just appeared,
than the variety of services in which he was engaged.
At one time he displayed his great personal courage and
skill as a swordsman in conflict with Sikh fanatics; was
then transferred to the civil service, in which he performed
his duties as though he had passed his whole life at the
desk, afterwards recruiting and commanding the corps of
Guides, and, lastly, taking part in the operations before
Delhi, volunteering for every enterprise in which life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>
could be hazarded or glory could be won. He crowded
into the brief space of eleven eventful years the services
and adventures of a long life. He died when his reward
was assured, obtaining only that reward which he most
coveted,&mdash;the consciousness of duty done, and the assurance
of enduring military renown. The other name to
which I shall refer is a name which will always be received
with feelings of special and individual interest by
this House. No words of mine can add to the glory
attaching to the short but noble career of Sir W. Peel.
(Cheers.) He bore a name which is inseparably connected
with the Parliamentary history of this country,
and it was with feelings of almost personal pride and
of personal grief that a great number of the members of
this House received the accounts of his glorious achievements
and of his untimely end. (Hear, hear.) For his
own reputation he had lived long enough; no future acts
could have enhanced his fame. It is England, it is his
country that deplores his loss."
</p>
</div>

<p>I have also much pleasure in stating that "in
testimony of the high sense entertained of the
gallant and distinguished services of the late
Brevet-Major W. S. R. Hodson," the Secretary
of State for India in Council has granted a special
pension to his widow.</p>

cut off. One night, on outlying picket at Meerut, this subject being
discussed, I said, 'Hodson is at Umb&acirc;la, I know; and I'll bet he will
force his way through, and open communications with the Commander-in-Chief
and ourselves.' At about three that night I heard
my advanced sentries firing. I rode off to see what was the matter,
and they told me that a party of enemy's cavalry had approached
their post. When day broke, in galloped Hodson. He had left Kurn&acirc;l
(seventy-six miles off) at nine the night before, with one led horse
and an escort of Sikh cavalry, and, as I had anticipated, here he was
with despatches for Wilson! How I quizzed him for approaching an
armed post at night without knowing the parole. Hodson rode
straight to Wilson, had his interview, a bath, breakfast, and two
hours' sleep, and then rode back the seventy-six miles, and had to
fight his way for about thirty miles of the distance."</p>

<p class="footnote">Another officer, writing to his wife at this time, says:&mdash;</p>

of the gate, which he had fixed on as the rendezvous, is called 'Hodson's

devoted band would have escaped, though the city would have been
ours."</p>

he could do anything for him. "Oh yes, sir," was the answer, "if you
would be so good as to read us anything in the papers about that Captain
Hodson; he's always doing something to make us proud of our
country, and of belonging to the same service as that noble fellow; it
makes one forget the pain."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_45" id="Footnote_45" href="#FNanchor_45"><span class="label">[45]</span></a> The following account of the assault, by an officer of the 1st
European Bengal Fusileers, will supply many particulars of interest:&mdash;</p>

<p class="footnote">"At 2 o'clock <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> we formed in front of our camp 250 strong, and
marched down to Ludlow Castle, which we reached about daybreak.
There we paused some time to receive our ladders, and advanced at
sunrise to the assault. Every man felt this day would repay him for
four months of hard knocks, and that we should give the murderous
ruffians a wholesome lesson, and teach them that a hand-to-hand
struggle with armed men was quite another affair to one with defenceless
women and children. We cross the glacis, the fire is hot; descend
and reascend the ditch, mount the berme and escalade. Hark!
what noise is that? not the Sepoy's war-cry 'Bum, Bum ram, ram,
Oh King' for which you are intently listening; but the wild, thrilling
cheer of the British, which announces to friend and foe that the ramparts
are won. We descend and meet in the Cashmere Bastion, and-are
astonished at our rapid success. A general shaking of hands
takes place. 'Oh, General, is that you?' 'Paddy, my boy, how are
you?' these and such like greetings take place, whilst the different
regiments form. We moved out rapidly and stormed the church and
adjacent buildings, and killed a number of Sepoys as they retreated
from the Water Bastion. After this, we proceeded round the ramparts
to our right without very much opposition, and halted at the
Cabul Gate for some time; again the word was forward, and in leading
on the men, my glorious friend George Jacob was mortally wounded;
he, poor fellow, was shot in the thigh, and died that night. As
he lay writhing in his agony on the ground, unable to stand, two or
three men went to take him to the rear, but a sense of duty was superior
to bodily pain, and he refused their aid, desiring them to go on
and take the guns. Twice did the enemy repulse us from this strong
position, our third attempt was successful, but two guns hardly repaid
us for our loss. 'Sergeant Jordan,' I said, 'spike that gun on the
rampart.' 'I can't, sir, I've no spikes.' 'Then take a ramrod, break
it in, and throw it down to me;' and I spiked the other gun in the
same way. The enemy eventually retook this position, but found
only useless guns. A little in advance, the enemy had a gun and
bullet-proof breastwork, behind which they fired on us with impunity.
This was on the rampart, and we were in a narrow lane about twelve
feet below, where not more than four men could go abreast. In one
charge, Nicholson, our best and bravest, was struck down. Speke,
gentle everywhere but in the field, was mortally wounded, and I, in
re-forming the regiment for a renewed attempt, was shot through the
right shoulder, which will prevent my being bumptious for some
time; out of our small party, seven officers and many, very many
men had fallen. It was felt to be madness to continue the struggle
where the enemy had all the advantage, and the troops were withdrawn
to the Cabul Gate, but the British and Sikh soldiers had done
their work, they had opened the road for our unrivalled artillery to
bring in their guns, and in six days they cleared the city with very
trifling loss on our side."</p>

as unconcerned as the sentries at the Horse Guards, and only by
his eyes and his ready hand, whenever occasion offered, could you

been exposed by order of Aurungzebe, the Great Mogul, nearly 200
years before. The Sikhs considered that in attacking Delhi they
were "paying off an old score." A prophecy had long been current
among them, that by the help of the white man they should reconquer
Delhi. After this they looked on Captain Hodson as the "avenger of
their martyred Gooroo," and were even more ready than before to
follow him anywhere.</p>

party, many with arms. Facing it, he looked up calmly, pointed his
carabine, and said, 'The first man that moves is a dead man.' The
effect was instantaneous. Not a hand was raised, and by the glance
of that eye, and effect of that voice, every disposition to interfere by
word or deed was quelled."&mdash;<i>Note by a friend, who afterwards visited

slumbering around, would, in the course of an half hour, be under
arms, and on the march to attack the enemy. Scarce a creature
in the camp, save General Mansfield, Adrian Hope, Hodson, and I,
knew the plans of the Commander-in-Chief. The men had gone to
bed as usual, when quietly orders were issued, and by half-past ten,
Hope, with his Brigade, was on his march." He then gives several
amusing native accounts of the action at Shumshabad, and afterwards
adds,&mdash;"Rode to see Hodson; he is much cut up about Macdowell's
loss, but treats his own wounds very lightly. Being in his

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
